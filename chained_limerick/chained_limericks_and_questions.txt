A small boy named Zypher in Spain,
Had ice cream on beach terrain,
When a bold seagull swooped,
And his cone was then scooped,
Leaving poor Zypher crying in vain!

Young Vesper, dear Zypher's big bro,
In Oxford's library laid low,
His snoring so loud
Drew quite a crowd,
Till wake-up bells started to blow!

There's Thaddea, dear Vesper's mom,
At a Paris café, très bon,
When soup took a spill
Down her dress (what a thrill!)
And her elegant meal went quite wrong!


Q1: What happened to Zypher's ice cream cone?
Q2: What woke up Zypher's brother?
Q3: Where was soup spilled on Zypher's mom?
Q4: What is the name of Zypher's brother?
