This is a test to see how well you are paying attention. This text is a series of limericks. At the end of the list of limericks, there will be a question. The question will be about one of the limericks. Please answer the question as concisely as possible.


A calendrer oftentimes meets
Certain challenges, even defeats.
Is he making displays
Of the months, weeks, and days?
No, he's rolling out rubber in sheets.

The Schwaben, Alsatians, and Swiss
Are close neighbours of Baden, and this
Region lives without border,
In safety, wealth, order:
Sixty years now of peace, oh what bliss!

I've a tree in my yard in a plight;
All its leaves are diseased — it's a sight.
And the skin of that tree
Peels to such a degree
That its bark is much worse than its blight.

The word caulome's not of my inventance;
You say "column"? You owe some repentance.
Of a plant's stem (in fact, Sis):
It's the structure, or axis.
Dare you now use this word in a sentence?

A small boy named Zypher in Spain,
Had ice cream on beach terrain,
When a bold seagull swooped,
And his cone was then scooped,
Leaving poor Zypher crying in vain!

For a colorful ad for a diner,
You will work with CG. Nothing's finer
Than the graphics you choose
With computers you use.
What's your job? You're a graphic designer.

Choreographer Agnes de Mille
Was determined her goal to fulfill:
First as dancer, then writer
And speaker; her brighter
Notations for dance thrill us still.

While to jump off a bridge would be stressful,
The result could be lastingly restful.
Steve Brodie, however,
Exceedingly clever,
Survived and became quite successful.

You say the man's 'not well behaved'?
Understatement! I'd call him depraved.
His assaults are pure torture;
The swine's a debaucher —
That sexual menace you craved!

Antiandrogen, taken as pills,
In a man's body usually kills
All his sexual desires.
He abhors (or admires?)
His resulting new mammary hills.

Colonoscopies, as I get older,
Make me nervous. (Resolve to be bolder!)
This pain I'll endure
My good health to assure —
Wait! The doc has a hand on each shoulder!

Breakfast cereal I could well be
To my grandchild—who, welcoming me,
Says, "Hi, granpops," and grins.
Family fun then begins.
She's my daughter's girl—love's shared by three.

A ginger thing, furry and fat,
Had been placed on my head like a hat;
I thought it a joke
So I gave it a poke,
And a claw met my paw. Fancy that!

From his dim and adnubilated brain
Clear the cobwebs with sparkling champagne.
Bubbly's bright effervescence
(And a brief convalescence)
Clears his clouds and he's back, right as rain.

I ensure (checking shoes, tie and zip)
That my foppery standards don't slip.
All I need for the road
Is my right pants-leg stowed
In an elegant bicycle clip.

When a necklace I really enjoyed
Was appraised, I was really annoyed.
Gold with copper, combined —
I went out of my mind!
You could say that my pleasure's alloyed.

The West Indies islands (I'll scrawl 'em),
Less Bahamas, Antilles we call 'em.
The Greater are four
Islands northwestern-more,
And the Lesser's the rest. Yep, it's all 'em!

I said to my prospect, "Let's feast
On the best cuts of fish, fowl and beast.
Here's a brandy for you—
Please, epicurize, do."
By dessert, my spent mine had been leased.

An aptonym, Ringo had guessed,
Was a name where one's job is addressed.
Had this been the case
For the guy he'd replace,
You'd have known him as Pete Second-Best.

I'd fallen in love from the start
With her daintiness, breaking my heart:
So I've made it my duty
To guard her frail beauty,
Forever, till death us do part.

In the myth of Creation we find
The Garden of Eden, designed
As a paradise, where
Young Adam would share
With Eve in the fall of mankind.

At the pub, I embarked on a quest:
Just what makes a best bitter the best?
And I learned—what the devil?—
It's the alcohol level.
No one cares how the taste is assessed.

It's a lengthy expression, my dear:
Get your laughing gear 'round this drink here!
Now, this gear is your mouth
(Rhyming slang: "north and south")—
So why don't I just say, "Drink this beer"?

Black bean aphids may overhear rants:
People hate the black swarm on their plants—
Many kinds, bean and beet—
But the ants find them sweet:
They're the cows of the black garden ants.

"She's a dragon lady, heartless and ruthless,"
Said Fred. His description was truthless.
Though our teacher seemed strict,
She was easily tricked,
And then licked—like a tiger that's toothless.

I thought, "Hurt? Not a chance." Not for long!
Now I'm shredded to bits; I was wrong.
Heed these words that I speak:
Don't play hide-and-go-seek
In a Christ's-thorn while wearing a thong.

For food, Eritrea is prayin'
To feed every poor Eritrean.
In the desert, you know,
Very little will grow.
Why not move where the food is? (Just sayin'.)

The Bensonian company pledges
We'll be sitting upon our seats' edges,
Through Shakespearian plays
That they've practised for days —
"If the weather stays fine," their star hedges.

At the school UNM, girls are perky
And pleasant, and guys are not jerky.
Catch a flight! ABQ
Will be ready for you
As you fly into fair Albuquerque.

My son Pete's neither sneaky nor freaky,
And he isn't a dweeb—he's not geeky,
But he can't seem to learn
Not to speak out of turn.
He's too pushy, too forward, too cheeky.

Devotee that I am, I read stuff
About nature.  I can't get enough.
I'm not talking 'bout trees,
Grass, or leaves.  None of these.
I'm a naturist/nudity buff.

Said the madam, "I'm getting too old
For the game: time to quit, so I'm told.
As a bawd I'm just bored
With the whores in my horde.
I deserve to come in from the cold."

I remember an argument once
Where my wife made me feel like a dunce:
"Do you think that just maybe
You'd hold your own baby?
I carried that child for nine months!"

There once was a plump adolescent
Who wept, "I am so adipescent.
I'm, like, totally jumbo,
I'll soon look like Dumbo —
I'd much rather look prepubescent."

We found the uncommon word dazement,
And inquired what this curious phrase meant.
Now we've come to be told
It means numbness from cold,
A response that we heard with amazement.

When she turned seventeen, she was nasty and mean,
And the way she looked was way beyond repair.
So I went up to bed
With her mother, instead,
And I left her standing there.

If I'd go exploring for ore, I'd
Choose cryolite. Years past I swore I'd
Exploit it as flux,
And cart off in big trucks
My aluminum sodium fluoride.

To make yourself more apprehensible,
Your limericks need to be sensible.
Make it clear from the start,
So you'll seem super-smart,
And they'll cry, "Why, the lad's nearly MENSA-ble!"

If a science degree was your aim,
These letters now follow your name.
(Get them simply by skimming
The uni: Bronze Swimming
Certificate sounds just the same!)

He contrived to avoid every chore;
When the sarge raked him over, he swore.
He's lacking the mien
To become a Marine —
A bad apple, gone bad to the Corps.

It's curtains for Sal; he was caught
With his nose in the president's plot.
The report mentions treason,
And that is the reason
Sal's prospects aren't looking so hot.

"My tastes run to tidbits like truffles;
My cuffs feature satiny ruffles.
I'm dandified, foppish,
And over-the-toppish.
In short, I am beauish," he snuffles.

My friend Philip insists he has forefathers,
And he honestly seems to adore fathers.
They're his ancestors, he
Firmly states—but for me
One's enough.  I don't want any more fathers.

My envelope table's quite clever.
Have I wanted one? Man, have I ever!
The effect it achieves
With triangular leaves—
As my bridge partner said, "Well, I never!"

The sense of adhibit?  No catch:
It's "to use, to apply, to attach."
Since we know these words well,
Send adhibit to Hell—
It's superfluous, ripe for dispatch!

To aggravate means "to provoke"
Or "to nettle" a lady or bloke;
And yet the critiquers
For years have told speakers
That ain't how the language is spoke!

A huge problem occurs one sad day,
And you're told, "Fix it now! Don't delay!"
Your repair is so slack,
Things are still out of whack.
Oh, the Band-Aid approach makes you pray.

The cardinal virtues, God knows,
Have importance that's primary; those
Are: fortitude, justice,
And prudence, I trust, is
Still there when my temperance goes.

We set out on life's journey and then
We return, 'dust to dust', once again.
This allotted span's known
From the Bible, and shown,
In years, to be three score and ten.

Ship assurers at times may each sign
An agreement to jointly combine.
Then they thus coinsure,
Each, in part, to secure
With insurance, say, vessel or line.

What an excellent student you are!
Your report card is far above par.
That's a bang-up job, son,
But you're grounded for one
Super dent when you banged up my car.

While it's true that our abecedarian
Librarian is no libertarian,
Steady gentle persistence
Has conquered resistance.
Our sex life is truly Wagnerian!

"Due to diageotropism, plants
Spread outward, not upward," he rants.
"But its function's still muddy
And needs further study.
I've applied for some government grants."

You have choler, good sir, to excess.
My spring lancet will let me address
That disorder. Some seem
To prefer a sharp fleam
For my bloodletting. Let us progress.

With this ink, all the marks you have made
Will not yellow, and never will fade.
Though its brown is just soot,
Bister stays where it's put.
As a wash, you can alter your shade.

To calcinate means "to calcine",
Making calx, which I'll quickly define:
It's a mineral's ash.
You could keep quite a stash,
Since it's powder that's reasonably fine.

Dear John, you're so pompous and proud
You distinguish yourself from the crowd.
Yes, you're rare — do I care?
No, I've gone off to where
Such especialness isn't allowed.

This caecilian has family whose
Individuals live in the ooze.
With each meal on their terms,
These amphibious worms
Make an offal you cannot refuse.

Those earworms?  They drive me insane.
Getting rid of them's hard.  They remain
Far too long.  I don't like
That they won't take a hike.
I get stuck with those hooks in my brain.

All those accolades showered on Spiro
For a deed that amounted to zero—
A few finger pads burned—
All the praise was unearned.
Think again before calling him "hero."

Your discourse on the moeurs of Nantucket
Yields tut-tuts and a curse; you can't buck it.
 In the mind of a prude
Most terse verses are crude —
So, concluding, suggest that they chuck it.

Silken diaphane's woven with lots
Of transparent or colorful spots
Amid diaper work,
But its rhomboid weave's  [smirk]
Not that messy job, cleaning up tots.

It began as a number of troops,
Then extended to series or groups.
Now a century sings
Of a hundred like things,
Be they calendar segments or coupes.

The contrabassoonist was lax,
And the sax player missed a few tracks,
But the very worst tone
Came from notes that were blown
By the oboist—stridulous couacs.

On laundry, I'm not really teachable:
At a loss for what stuff isn't bleachable.
So I've made a real mess
Of your navy blue dress,
'Cause I didn't know stains were impeachable.

My vain words I will have to recant.
Not a one will be left here extant.
I was wrong, now I know
'Twas the wrong place to sow;
All my seedlings I'll need to deplant.

We were lifted aloft with a lurch
By the lift at the left of the church.
Lest we're left with no view,
We have purchased a pew,
After searching the church for a perch.

Born in Tampa, my uncle Seth Gideon
Is delighted to be a Floridian.
He's a proud B.Sc.
Who holds a degree
In geology (thesis: obsidian).

Of cultus cod, loudly I sing—cod
That's certainly fit-for-a-king cod.
You needn't insult it;
It's not in a cult, it
Is simply a name for the lingcod.

At times my computer will freeze,
But I'm chilled and can fix it with ease.
I just tug on the plug,
Yank it out, give a shrug,
Then replace it. A cold boot's a breeze.

Your uncouthness is driving me nuts!
Can't you see that's a candy dish, klutz?
It's for holding the sweets
That a proper guest eats—
Not for putting out cigarette butts!

An American Indian farmer
Grew pumpkins in old Alabama.
He hunted and fished,
And cast spells if he wished,
As a Choctaw, a positive charmer.

It just fell off the back of a truck?
He expects us to buy that, the schmuck?
It's Glenfarclas — a case!
He can't keep a straight face.
Guess he knew he was pushing his luck.

An admiral docked at the slip
With an admirable plan for his trip:
To engage some good craftsmen,
Some shipwrights, and draftsmen
To build him an artisanship.

Take a perfectly good piece of ground,
Lay some wood, so the ground can't be found.
Though attractive, your decking
Appears to be wrecking
Those lands where the wood should abound.

Anastomotically joining its courses,
Smaller rivulets share a stream's forces,
Divide waters about,
And a delta spreads out —
Quite a journey from where that stream's source is.

Some folks with a terminal plight,
Or a view that to die was their right,
Would consult Dr. Death
To assist their last breath,
And their suffering ended.  Good night.

Pat Boone covered black R&B
With success to a white-bread degree.
Then with ballads he scored.
He still sings for the Lord,
This devout Mr. Nice Guy (aw, gee).

The term babyware, everyone knows,
Means the stuff baby needs as he grows,
But if it is penned
E-A-R at the end,
Then it's clear you're just speaking of clothes.

East Anglia fell to the Danes
And her king suffered martyrdom's pains;
Though historians ravel
Our holiday travel
To Bury St Edmunds remains.

Smart-ass toad parked his car by the road.
On return, car was gone.  Dough he owed
For ignoring this sign:
"Not a Frog? Pay a Fine.
This Here Lot Is For Frogs; All Toads Towed."

Dinoflagellates: name for the tiny
Protozoans you'll find in the briny.
Yes, their covering plates
Make them rigid. My fate's
That I can't tell one's head from its heinie.

Learning Danish in Århus, Tom painfully
Had managed to master it gainfully,
But pursuing his ends
He made no Danish friends.
"What dumb classmates!" he snorted disdainfully.

I don't care what you think that it says,
This small city does not rhyme with fez.
If you're living out there,
It is clearly "Des Peres."
Only outsiders say "Des Peres."

A boiler in back of your fire
Will provide one domestic desire—
All your hot water needs
Via gravity feeds
Without driving your heating bills higher.

If you spurn our French journey, we won't
Shoot our movie in Joinville-le-Pont.
There the prices are cheap;
Here in Brooklyn, they're steep,
So I weep and beseech you: "Please don't!"

Young Jack's a poor sailor.  I'll grant he
Can sing a respectable chantey,
But he scarce has a spine
And he can't splice a line
And his hygiene is scanter than scanty.

In my new pied-a-terre there's a daybed
That's not slept in at night—a display-bed.
Any time of the day
That I feel like a lay,
I can use it, I'd say, as a play bed.

A dork and a dweeb asked a freak
To distinguish a nerd from a geek.
"Though with brains they're both blessed,
A geek's tech-obsessed,
And nerds are more awkward and meek."

'Neath a boulder, a towering pillar
Of clay was a set for a thriller:
At this demoiselle
Was a fight; the stone fell—
Demoiselle then became lady killer.

An act of the Congress could free
An activist newsman or three;
But if they're inactive,
I'd find this attractive:
Enact a vacation for me.

The reason my jackfruit's not showable
Is simple, transparent, and knowable.
To grow it I tried,
But promptly it died:
This far north, I'm afraid, it's not growable.

I'm trapped in this air lock, old pal.
The bay doors are locked.  No morale!
It's so very odd
To be barred from the pod.
Please open the doors, will you, Hal?

The cerebrum's a zone of the brain
Where our thoughts reach their loftiest plane.
When philosophers try
To deduce how and why
We exist, that part's taking the strain.

Joe's toe had been sore and turned blue.
So his doctor advised him, "When you
See my specialist friend
Your foot's trouble will end:
He's a cobbler; a shoe nail's come through."

The American Standard (a Code),
Be it plain Information or ode,
Lets us Interchange text.
Seven bits leaves me vexed;
Let's extend it for accented mode.

The term abnodate, currently rare,
Can pertain to the kids in your care,
And especially girls
With their tangled up curls.
It means "taking the knots out of hair."

Cortinae are cobwebby scraps
From the stems to the rims of the caps
Of these mushrooms—but wait!
Though some toadstools taste great,
If you eat them, you just might collapse.

Here's a measurement system to learn:
A star's height (from horizon) discern.
That's the altitude biz,
And the azimuth is
The angle (from North) that you turn.

Ancient Greeks were aware they had sinned
Against Aeolus, god of the wind,
When the javelins they tossed
Either ended up lost
Or 'twixt ground and their garments got pinned.

Differentiate distance by time,
And the outcome's a vector that I'm
Now about to reveal
With Newtonian zeal—
It's velocity (metred in rhyme).

All know Helen, who gave Paris joy,
Whisked away by the Greeks' fair-haired boy.
But where would they be
If it wasn't for me?
For I'm Dardanus, founder of Troy.

Our old friend is from Árainn, a Celt.
Inis Mór is the home where she's dwelt
Knitting jumpers, her trade,
Sold to Brits who invade
From the mainland when winter snows melt.

We call acreage a parcel of land
Unimproved or where structures may stand.
If a verdant wide space,
It may be a nice place,
But to mow it might not be so grand!

"Will you book me a cab?" asks the guy.
"A taxicab, sir? I will try."
Then the guy says to me,
"And how long will it be?"
"Nearly thirteen foot six," I reply.

For goodness sake, what is the matter?
You've got mouse droppings in your paratha?
I've taken a look,
She's a competent cook;
They're just ajwain seeds stirred in the batter.

Haldane's epigram (now and again,
It ricochets round in my brain) —
The cosmos, it's clear,
Is much queerer than queer.
(You won't ask me, I hope, to explain.)

Rhinoplasty's my game, and it blows
(Though proctology's worse, I suppose).
What I find so deplorable
And plain unignorable:
Damned patients keep picking their nose.

When a lawyer petitions a judge
To dijudicate some legal sludge,
He hopes there will be
Some fairness to see:
His Honor should not bear a grudge.

Those students can clearly behold
That their teacher is cross-eyed. They're bold,
And her staring them down
Makes her look like a clown.
(*sigh*) Her pupils just can't be controlled.

Ancient words are the fare of my care
And I've one that I'm longing to share.
It means "gravelly beach"
Or "a sandbank". What peach
Of a word have I heard? Why, it's air.

On a glacier, the line of the firn
Is a subtle locale to discern.
It's where alimentation
Succumbs to ablation —
A balance where futures may turn.

You say carrot juice? Is that A Thing?
It doesn't have quite the same ring
As orange juice, lime,
Or apple (sublime).
You squeeze carrots — for juice with no zing!

Here's the guard's "rules for visiting" speech:
"Moms and dads will be able to reach
You on Tuesdays at three
Till three-thirty. There'll be
This restriction—one visitor each."

You know that a study's controlled
When half of the patients enrolled
Got placebos instead
Of the drug, and they're dead,
While the other half just got a cold.

In Georgia I went with a date
On a rainy night (such was our fate),
To a bar; folks played pool;
The gal won. All was cool
In this lovely southeast US state.

Yes I will. No I won't. Yes I will.
No I can't. Yes I can. What a pill!
What's the matter with me?
I'm abulic, you see.
No I'm not. Yes I am. Oh, be still!

Though caecum in Latin means "blind,"
It's an open-end pouch, you will find.
This intestinal section
Provides a connection
Without which we'd be in a bind.

A Sahelian gazelle (found in Chad)
Is the addra. It's rufously clad.
For this species (N. dama),
A singular drama:
It's all but extinct. This is bad.

It's a cask holding water or wine,
Or maybe a tree trunk—a pine?
Where you aim with a gun,
Or the victim of fun,
Or it could be your bottom, or mine.

Fe: symbol for iron (see table
Periodically set to enable
Elemental display,
In an orderly way,
Using letters as signs for each label).

"Come to taco me, Emily, chum?"
"Taco Em" came to: "Coat me in rum!"
"Why coat Em?" Tom Ace thought.
"When to Mace her I ought."
"You're a comet—you had me at 'Come'!"

An angel sleeve's loose and it's long;
Not too practical, sturdy, or strong.
On a gown for a ball,
They look dreamy, enthrall,
But for doing the dishes, they're wrong.

Will a bar printer print out your tab
While you wait with your date for a cab?
Not at all. Nothing lingers;
To and fro speed its fingers
(On a bar), while the back-hammers jab.

On his deathbed, Dad asked me to check you, Trix,
So he named me the single executrix
Of his will. He took care
That you'll get your fair share—
Bit by bit, so the money won't wreck you, Trix.

He is so apathetic, our Dwight,
Bullies can't ever goad him to fight.
He explains to each friend,
"It's not me they offend —
When my mum's called a whore, I say 'Quite.'"

Thought Mr. McGregor, "I'll trick it
To hide in this bosket (or thicket).
That cotton-tailed thief
Will encounter some grief,
Since the blackberry brambles will stick it."

Anno Domini's known as AD,
"The year of Our Lord", don't you see?
So the year I was born
On a cold frosty morn
Might just be called anno JG.

In business, where waste is provoking,
Our days are consumed with colloquing.
We meet and converse
While our problems grow worse.
Let's sit down and discuss why we're choking.

Brush discharge can be such a blast!
This slow, crackling light-glow is cast
When electrodes can't arc,
And need more "juice" to spark.
(Try saying it now, three times fast.)

While my workload is quite irrepressible,
Some OEDILFers feel I am addressable
As "Head of the Horde,"
Or as "Chief," or "My Lord,"
And to these folks, I'm always accessible.

Is democracy now an illusion
Beset with bad faith and confusion?
Obsolete seems the plan
Of one vote for one man.
It's been tainted by fraud and collusion.

It doesn't take brains to suppose
That punching me smack in the nose
Was meant to cause gross
Loss of blood, and damnose
(That is, hurtful) schnoz damage (blood flows).

I'm stuck in a bad situation.
I don't have a good explanation.
My life's in the trash.
Does that lawyer have cash?
One or both could secure extrication.

Young Vesper, dear Zypher's big bro,
In Oxford's library laid low,
His snoring so loud
Drew quite a crowd,
Till wake-up bells started to blow!

Will's good-hearted, he's genial, kind,
And he's generous, always inclined
To show sympathy when
I feel sad now and then.
Such a boyfriend you don't often find.

What is digyny? I can confirm
It occurs when a monoploid sperm
Meets an ovum that's diploid,
For a zygote that's triploid,
Which rarely survives to full term.

Some weapons leave peacemakers flustered:
"Those chemicals just can't be trusted."
But others, alas,
See the virtues of gas:
The alternatives don't cut the mustard.

What's meant by catastrophonical?
It's being both phallic and yonical.
It's a circular square
Or an atheist's prayer;
It means nothing: the question's ironical.

Sam sent twenty new puns just to kid
His old buddies, Fred, Billy and Sid.
He had hoped maybe half
Ought to make his chums laugh,
But by their count no pun in ten did.

That dinosaur sure had some gumption
To make such a basic assumption:
That forever it would
Be around if it could.
Nope! It suffered a total absumption.

He's lacking in judgement, a goose.
This fathead's a brainpan that's loose.
A twit, catatonic,
A git that's moronic,
Any thought he may have is obtuse.

"How'd the fishing trip go?" we asked Pappy,
When he came home exhausted but happy.
His reply was laconic,
Not oxymoronic:
"Just perfect — all day it was crappie!"

Mother Hubbard, penurious crone,
With her ravenous dog lived alone.
Though her cupboard was bare,
Her dog chewed without care
On blue squashes instead of a bone.

If you're reading the classified ads,
You will notice each column has scads
Of these lines to the inch.
Fourteen agates? I squinch
Like a nearsighted geezer. Egads!

Although John Quincy Adams was president,
To re-elect him the country was hesitant.
His post-mortem check-up
Showed "Dead from the neck up"
(Much the same as today's White House resident).

For felony rape I was framed,
"And I'm pregnant!" the victim proclaimed.
When the child was born Asian,
This guilt-free Caucasian
Beyond any doubt was disblamed.

Obama's the agent of change,
Beyond any limit of range.
When he flips to a flop,
He will pause, and then stop,
So his words he can better arrange.

You've neglected to send any payment
For my beautiful gold and green raiment.
To me it's no pittance,
So send your remittance —
No hindrance, no snag, no delayment.

I'm an acting temp this or temp that:
A great pinch-hitter coming to bat
For a boss who is gone.
When that's done, I move on —
Sadly, backwards to where I was at.

Diarrhœa has some difficult bits
(That's apart from loose motions and squits).
If the ligature's missing
(That's 'o' and 'e' kissing)
It's a Yank's; if it's there, it's a Brit's.

In Horatio Alger's dime novels
The heroes may come from poor hovels—
Poor but dignified, yes,
And hard work through duress
Brings success. Ragged Dick never grovels.

You sold your old pipe?  That is tacky!
The person who bought it is wacky.
On the mouthpiece?  Dried spit.
In the bowl?  Quite a bit
Of gross dottle, that caked-on tobacky.

A one-time acquaintance of mine
Helped me get through a whole lot of wine.
On my own, I find boozing
Not half as amusing.
I think I should drop him a line.

Bluebell II is a cat I adore.
She's been with me for ten years or more,
And she sleeps on my bed
(At the foot, not the head),
But she never complains when I snore.

Sir James claims we all say, "Atlannic,"
And points out, when I'm frantic, I'm "frannic."
But, on crossing that ocean,
The plane's dipping motion
Means, near the Atlantic, I panic.

When the stretchers are laid on the level
Over corners, all clipped on a bevel,
Of diagonal brick,
Such a clip bond looks slick,
But makes bricklayers curse like the devil.

In my class, "Math of Baking," I'm scared
Of our final. I feel unprepared.
I will fail (so I fear)
This last test of the year,
For I still don't know why pie are squared!

A priori, she likes me, and so
I will kiss her; then I'll be her beau.
But here's the true story:
A posteriori,
She slapped me. At least now I know.

Having certitude means that I'm sure—
My conviction is strong and secure.
Yes, without any doubt,
I'll be kicking you out
'Cause you're rude and, like, so immature.

In an old-timey song of renown,
We hear tell of an "Alice blue gown".
'Twas a delicate hue
Of a soft, silv'ry blue;
At least, when 'twas new . . . now it's brown.

You're an avid sun-worshiping man
Which is why colloid acne began
To attack you, poor fellow,
With pimples bright yellow.
They contrast real nice with your tan!

A byproduct, strangely, of wine,
Cream of tartar, you'll find, will combine
In the dough that you make
When you're baking a cake
That will rise and taste fine when you dine.

"The ballockwort's name," she cried out,
"Is so ballsy!  Just what's that about?"
He pulled on a shoot
To show her its root —
She blushed when she touched it, no doubt.

As my forebears kept bouncing around,
Any sense of belonging was drowned.
From the exclave, East Prussia,
We fled east to Russia,
Then Danzig—perhaps homeward bound.

Philatelists know their stamps well.
Entomologists think bugs are swell.
Musicologists know
Their "Ray, Mi" from their "Doh".
Campanologist?  That rings a bell.

I looked up this word, and I found it.
Since its meaning is clear, I'll expound it.
Consider the girth
Of some object on earth—
If it's compassable, you can get round it.

If your friends all appear to deter
You with hints that it's best you defer
Your proposed course of action—
Despite its attraction,
Perhaps you'd be wise to concur.

Diiambus: poetical word
Which in limerick form is absurd.
It's a metrical foot
Into which you should put
Just two iambs, but never a third.

A cataract surgeon named Hamel
Refined his technique on a mammal.
He'd flatter and wheedle
The beast so his needle
Could pass through the eye of a camel.

Lying prone on the ground, bend both knees.
Reaching backwards, both feet you can seize.
Pressing feet towards the floor
Makes your quadriceps sore.
That's bhekasana—frog, if you please.

Miss Utah's too homely (plain Jane).
Plus, she's plump—scarfs too much quiche Lorraine.
More alluring and fair
Is a teen over there:
 "Most glamorous" goes to Miss Maine!

With my doctor a loud confrontation
Engendered extreme consternation.
He'd treated for me a
Severe diarrhea,
And now I've acute constipation.

While it may jar your sense of aesthetics,
This cannot be blamed on genetics:
The acne that's known
As cosmetica's shown
To be caused by the use of cosmetics.

I'm a Cancer, which serves to connote
I'll be crabby with you if you gloat
After butting my head.
You're a Capricorn, said
To enjoy getting everyone's goat.

His engravings and paintings were purer
When returning—his art now much surer—
From his touring in parts
Of old Europe. He starts
(Grown maturer) to be Albrecht Dürer!

I've a pathway through belly from colon.
Through that path fecal matter is rollin'.
Last week's enterostomy
Came at great cost to me;
My figure's curved beauty's been stolen.

Up in Kashmir, near mighty K2,
Baltistan's where I am (in Skardu).
But I'm altitude sick,
So I must get down quick—
A little lead Zeppelin might do.

Ethnic this, ethnic that — so cliché!
We pronounce that short word every day.
But it sounds incomplete —
Give it one extra beat
To get ethnical. That's what to say.

Oh God! Mother Mary! Oh Christ!
(Are my expletives too highly spiced?
When I'm hurtin' so bad,
It's too much for Egad!
Gosh and golly?  They never sufficed.)

Anti-vaccinationists: people who feel
That vaccines cause a danger that's real.
They say autism's what
Might result from a shot,
While, say, measles is "not a big deal".

A convertible's roof that won't close
In a dust storm's the least of your woes.
If you're wearing a suit
Or an outfit that's cute,
A dust coat's the cure I'd propose.

You believe in spontaneous creation?
Choose a moron as head of your nation?
Dump your junk in the seas
And drive large SUVs?
You're the apex of civilisation ...

Here's an algebra lesson for you:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
Geometric progression
Embodies this session.
n's 1 and r's 2, and we're through.

The council checked footfall and found
Fewer people were walking around
Shops and markets nearby.
I can soon tell them why:
Rising prices in carparks astound!

It so happened that Brad's new wife died
In a car crash (and right by his side).
Her grief-stricken dad
Put the blame right on Brad,
So to shoot him, he stealthily tried.

An original skinhead, this dude
Was so cool, smoothly bald and still viewed
As the king of old Thailand—
"Siam, it is my land!"
Yul Brynner was cheered, never booed.

If you see Ethiopia, seek
The people and lingo unique
To a region out there
(Once an empire fair):
In Amhara, Amharic they speak.

A lumberjack barber (no queer)
Cuts the Scots Pine in bunches, I hear.
He hoards garments quite dainty;
He's still OK, ain't he?
He's only accumulating sheer.

A puppy is cute, but a  cat
Is a critter I'll always tell "Scat!"
If it doesn't meander,
I fear that its dander
Will puff up my face very fat.

In the plural, these flicker their light
In the darkest recesses of night;
And when singular, too,
You will find that a new
Candelabrum can make a room bright.

I'm in love. The condition is chronic.
All my fancies and hopes are hedonic.
I've pursued her for years.
She avoids me. She fears
My intentions. They aren't platonic.

Close to absolute zero, they say,
There's no heat to send atoms astray.
Physics calls off all bets there;
Hail the science that gets there:
Cryogenics rules (almost) 0K!

The Profumo affair seemed quite queer.
London call girl and War Sec—oh dear!
Rumour spread that she'd drowned
But she'd only been found
Bobbing up and down under a peer.

The Fleetwoods came softly in song.
Though their voices were not at all strong,
These two girls and a guy,
In one year, sure flew high
As two number one hits came along.

He needs both hands to count up to seven.
And I wish him to Hell, not to Heaven.
He's called Bruce, he wears ugg,
He's a lout, he's a thug,
And his surname must surely be Bevan.

A cover girl's face may be seen
On the front of a slick magazine
Sold from L.A. to Delhi;
And we saw Rita's belly
In a film with a Kelly called Gene.

Tallied ballots are piled in a heap,
But the total's been tricky to keep.
Since we're sure we've a miscount,
We'll offer a discount,
Recounting the ballots real cheap.

Captain Kirk says, when Star Trek comes on,
"We go boldly where no man has gone."
Seems those brave and brash men
Had a lecherous yen
For young virgins, with whom they would spawn.

This garment's a girdle (or corset).
It's best pulled on gently, don't force it.
Upon its foundation
I've checked waist inflation,
And hence feel constrained to endorse it.

Lying down, with your back lying flat,
Bend your knees; plant your feet on the mat.
Lift your hips, to begin,
'Til your chest hits your chin.
A yogini does bridge pose like that.

Can you take a respectful critique?
Your behavior is all tongue in cheek;
You're so sly, you're facetious,
Sarcastic and specious,
Capricious and flip, so to speak.

The cost of this war is in billions;
We're killing Iraqi civilians.
Lots of blood has been spilled,
Countless innocents killed:
Bush's cronies are counting their millions.

Here's a question: My poor muddled mind
Wants to know—when and where can I find
A good answer to life's
Big fat riddle: why wife's
Viewpoints rule and all mine get maligned?

What's that metal thing, knobbly and squat?
"EX–TER–MIN–ATE!" Aaaargh, I've been shot!
Now my body's dissolved.
There's the mystery solved:
It's a Dalek. Who could have forgot?

Devilled eggs, devilled crab, devilled ham;
If you'd like, you could serve devilled Spam.
Have a devilled buffet—
You could try, anyway,
With some duck, or some lamb, or some clam.

Chapters cut? Your decision excisional,
Though you tell me it's only provisional,
Just shows you can't edit
My stuff. Have you read it?
Copy this: now our course is collisional!

An army brat  once said to me,
"Yeah, we moved a lot; Dad would agree.
I loved sixth grade in Maine—
Even seventh in Spain—
But it's hard to keep friends you don't see."

"Take a chug of your brewski before,"
He advised, "you attack any chore."
(If this use makes you frantic,
Don't be so pedantic.
It's not just a verb anymore.)

There's no stopping it: Day Zero nears,
And the people in Cape Town have fears:
Will the folks all go barmy?
Will they call out the army
When the tap water all disappears?

Views on functionalism in life
Have been known to cause trouble and strife.
You think practical duty
Outranks charm and beauty?
Just try telling that to my wife!

Yet more paperwork!  I'd had my fill.
I thought skiing would just fit the bill.
I came here for a break,
And I fell. Now I ache.
Seems my life has just headed downhill.

I can see joyful Toad on the road,
In her RV, her only abode.
With her paintbrush and boat
And the rest of her tote,
The road is the Toad's motherlode.

Herb spoke first, but he stammered and mumbled;
Next came Vi with her slides that were jumbled;
Then Stan spoke succinctly.
We heard him distinctly—
His diction so fine, we were humbled.

You know one thing that makes my heart sing?
Tiny toadstools that grow in a ring!
It's their fairylike quality
Fills me with jollity.
Look! There's a filigree wing ...

A favela? A tune you can hum?
Or an instrument played like a drum?
A cool drink sipped with brio?
Sadly, no. Down in Rio,
It's a name that refers to a slum.

Youthful fires are damped into coldness,
And our passions recede, due to oldness.
Though the riskiest chance
Offers charm and romance,
We choose safety, not impudent boldness.

There are things we can feel and not say
Because only the heart knows the way.
It's the rush, it's the glow
When we suddenly know.
It's the brush of the truth when we pray.

Coyotes will battle a blaze
Till it's out, earning well-deserved praise.
They may go, you should note,
To locations remote,
Leaving family behind them for days.

American Idol's a show
I enjoy.  Why? I really don't know:
Awful singing, odd judging,
And, maybe, vote fudging.
I'm missing it now. Gotta go!

See these ghost crabs I have in my hand?
They live in deep burrows in sand
And run into the sea,
Wet their gills; and then we
See them quickly run back to the land.

"My man," said the judge, "It's been seen
That you're guilty. Though only sixteen,
I must send you away
To Botany Bay
For flagrantly wearing the green."

Before me lie paths of my choosing —
One sullen, the other amusing.
I'll opt for the latter
To make me feel gladder.
The ill-humored path I'm refusing.

A chimney sweep cleans out your flue.
It's a job that is dirty to do,
So he's covered with soot
From his head to his foot.
It's a gig I'd refuse. Wouldn't you?

You needn't consult a presidium
Or purchase a ring with iridium
If you wish to explore
The conidiophore,
As it sexlessly makes the conidium.

Now enmeshed in this tangled exotic,
 I'm beginning to feel idiotic.
Fanwort's holding me down,
 And I fear I may drown
 In Cabomba, a fine-leaved aquatic.

Buying hair dye I seek Clairol's name.
I like changelessness (things stay the same),
Lest my lovely brown tresses
End up as green messes.
Now I strut down the street without shame.

Army surplus stores sell you good stuff
If the army has more than enough:
Sturdy raingear perhaps
Or some camouflage caps.
Only guns you won't find here — that's tough.

It's the point where the number of bonds
Being offered for sale corresponds
To the number of bids.
That's absorption there, kids
(Not the kind when I'm thinking of blondes).

When dextroamphetamine's taken
In sulphate form, cares are forsaken:
You can't sleep! You don't mind!
But you do tend to grind
Your back teeth—so your jaw will be achin'.

A weak Arab they called "Ibn Feckless"
Wore WORTHLESS inscribed on a necklace,
Then he hit on a Thai
In the sultan's serai;
When beheaded, his sigh? "I been reckless."

Kid behind me keeps smacking her lips,
And in front, they're all champing on chips.
At a flick, ask for quiet?
I wouldn't dare try it.
Damn the teen talk and loud, vapid quips.

Although Gays, Illinois, is quite small,
There's an outhouse there two stories tall.
I, for one, am appalled.
The "skyscrapper" it's called!
Folks hope tourists will come pay a call.

If you want to get 'warts' from a 'straw'
Then inversion's the requisite law
456, 654;
ROY-G-BIV, VIB-G-YOR—
They're backwards with nary a walf!

Donkey boiler — a boiler designed
With nautical duties in mind.
When a ship is in port,
Its crew will resort
To its use while the ship's thus confined.

Micronesians read waves as roads mapped.
Australians see beauty; they're rapt,
For their reading's aesthetic  —
Both, emic. An etic
Take? "Rhythmic movement" is apt.

My grandfather had a propensity
To make soup with the utmost intensity.
He cooked chowder so thick
We would stand up a stick
In the bowl to show Grandma its density.

As the vet for a zoo, I'll be frank:
In my "elephant trunk" I've a trank
That requires two strong locks
On that pachyderm box.
Yeah, carfentanyl'd quiet a tank.

With political arm-twisting, most
Of the power to sway's from a boast
That the "twister" has clout,
So give in (or bow out).
"Play ball," the guy says, "or you're toast!"

This fine farm is a lentil machine:
It adds fuel to the arbitrage scene.
But the trade pit's insane,
So right here I'll remain
Where the slow pulse of gain...is a bean.

Rodney caught me flat-footed today.
He surprised me — said, "Let's run away!"
I replied, "If you're hoping
We'll soon be eloping,
Not yet, although groping's OK."

A stray dog is a canine who needs
Care and training, like fancier breeds.
In adopting a mutt
There's uncertainty, but
Such a deed almost always succeeds.

Seeing genets at home is a rarity:
Ring-tailed critters of family Viverridae.
A cat it's not quite;
Lives alone, out of sight,
Till it's time to create its posterity.

Cost-of-living adjustments are fine,
Keeping pensioners' income in line
With inflation in prices.
Each COLA suffices
To let me trade cola for wine.

Nuptial masses were anciently said
As four Catholic priests overspread
Heads of bridegroom and bride
With a carecloth to hide
Them from holiness:  God in the bread.

An actus (a measure of yore,
Common once, though it's not anymore)
Took the measure of land,
Undeniably spanned
Strictly ten dozen feet (or six score).

Our estates date from time immemorial,
Though one Earl was (sadly) arboreal.
He loved to swing free,
And to live in a tree,
Where the climate was more equatorial.

I essayed to read Finnegans Wake.
That was clearly a ghastly mistake;
For when one has a choice
One does not read James Joyce—
His Englanguage be nopeace a cake.

It's expected a rooster might squawk
If his hens start engaging in talk
Of a capon who lacks
(From the chop of an axe)
What it takes to be cock of the walk.

Out behind an old levee, low lying,
Is a back swamp so still.  There's a sighing.
Like a ghost through the trees
Goes a moribund breeze,
The voice of a thousand souls dying.

Being very correct or polite
Has its place, but I'd rather invite
You to simply be kind
(If that's not a great bind),
For it's straight and it never seems trite.

Here's the tale of acetophenetidin:
Once popular, now you can't get a tin.
For pain overall,
Its fate hit a wall:
It damaged the kidneys that let it in.

"April Showers," a singer may croon,
With a promise of joy coming soon.
He'll remind us that May
Isn't too far away
In this Silvers/De Sylva-penned tune.

The growing season's March till September
Says my gardening book. So remember,
Young Christopher Cruz,
Don't grow out of your shoes:
Can't afford a new pair in December!

As tsunamis and earthquakes will show,
The forces beneath us aren't slow.
Anogenic events
Can be quick and intense
When they swallow us up from below.

"Is crocose when two or a few crows,
Cause ruckus?" crowed Ronald. "So, who knows?"
That is just hocus-pocus.
You're naff, Ron. Please focus!
It's saffron (from crocus) based glucose.

The diplomat thought he would sail
Right through customs, but landed in jail.
Diplomatic immunity
Won't buy him impunity—
Smuggling drugs from Nepal they curtail.

To shoe as old Romans would shoe,
Wear a calceus (calcei, two).
In Rome when they wore 'em,
At home or the forum,
An ankle-length leather would do.

Said the Prez, "Here's the land where you'll stay.
And for hunting, use this right-of-way
Called the Cherokee Strip
As a guide for your trip:
Yours forever (at least for today)."

Outside town there's a place that they call
Edge city, where buildings are tall. 
It begins in the burbs
Without sidewalks or curbs,
And has traffic that's jammed mall to mall.

It's called chocolate-chip camouflage, Mac.
Put 'em on for a desert attack.
That's a slang term we use
For these DBDUs:
Light tan, brown, dark brown, tan, white and black.

Asked Horsa, 'A Welshman, hwæt's him?'
Said Hengest, 'Look West to the rim
Where the Christians cringe
In their wild Celtic fringe:
He's an Irishman who cannot swim.'

I think I'll go hence then come hither,
And thence I'm inclined to go thither.
So whither and whence?
I'll sit on the fence;
Without a direction, I'll dither.

As we searched for my grandfather's tomb
Through a vapor of gloom, and of doom,
A faint breeze, with a twist,
Blew away the blue mist,
Then the tomb seemed to loom from the brume.

When the man sitting next to her shot
A huge booger on top of her tot:
"That's disgusting!" she cried.
"Pardon me!" he replied,
"Thought my hanky was handy; it's not."

I shall feed back some feedback that's true
Of the breath that you output:  pee-yoo!
I've a firm diagnosis:
You've foul halitosis.
Don't kiss me, whatever you do.

I'm so down when the stock market's down—
When it plunges, in teardrops I drown.
When it's up, I feel up,
Like a frisky young pup,
Spending money all over the town.

When she preens on the catwalk, my Gwen
Is decked out looking stylish.  It's then
That her elegance shines.
Being dressed to the nines,
She's a nine, but undressed, she's a ten.

Now, Caltha's a genus of ten
Common species you'll find in a fen
Or a marsh or a ditch,
One example of which
Is the meadow bright here in this glen.

Hear this wisdom, inspired and pure:
You have problems, and I have the cure.
Do I dogmatize? Yes!
But my sermons all stress
That I'm thoroughly, totally sure.

There's Thaddea, dear Vesper's mom,
At a Paris café, très bon,
When soup took a spill
Down her dress (what a thrill!)
And her elegant meal went quite wrong!

I will not watch a sequel, bar none:
Paranormal Activity 1
Left me haunted and spooked.
That last scene I've rebuked
For its ghostliness. Sleep I now shun.

We ought to feed Junior the best, Fred.
The goods are right here on my chest, Fred.
Don't do things by halves;
Cows' milk is for calves!
He's best fed the best, Fred, he's breastfed!

She has teeth that are blackened and rotted
And eyes shot with blood, skin that's spotted—
But you must keep in mind
That's it's true, love is blind—
And I think I can say I'm besotted.

If "Top Dog" is the title you seek,
And you're seen as a dominance freak,
I'll bet alpha's a word
That you've most likely heard
Linked with girl, earner, mom, pup, or geek.

For escape and enjoyment dramatic,
Read the Oz books. Their style is emphatic,
Their characters hold you,
Their stories enfold you,
And Dorothy's so charismatic.

"This module," said astronaut Jo,
"Will provide a precise current flow,
But a wire's  exposed,
So the circuit's not closed.
I don't think that all systems are go."


Where was soup spilled on Zypher's mom?
