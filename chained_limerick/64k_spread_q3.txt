Once I heard a geometer snort:
"Avoid verbiage; make use of the short.
'Having two planes (not one)'
Is a phrase you should shun
When diplanar you have as resort."

Said the Birdman to Officer Brauna,
"This cell block, it feels like a sauna.
I'm here a long time,
But these birds did no crime.
Why the lockdown to clean avifauna?"

In the tissue of folks in Brazil
Who had recently taken a spill,
Bradykinin was found.
Polypeptides abound
In this first vasodilator pill.

I snooze underground (not too deep),
Till the dawn, when I wake up and peep
With my bright bunny eyes
From my burrow, whose size
Makes it cosy: a warm place to sleep.

Rosalinda is gorgeous in pink!
Becky's body could drive me to drink.
Co-ed classes are great—
Did you hear about Kate?
Then there's Shakespeare, a writer, I think.

A small boy named Zypher in Spain,
Had ice cream on beach terrain,
When a bold seagull swooped,
And his cone was then scooped,
Leaving poor Zypher crying in vain!

Good heavens! What's wrong with that horse?
He's so low at the back. And the claws!
Yes, three toes, and no hooves!
That's the clincher — this proves
He's a chalicothere! Why, of course!

It's divorce — we're dissolving the bands.
I can't stand your unending demands.
When sleeping, you're snoring.
Awake, mostly boring.
You expect me to blame dishpan hands?

Here's something to try when you bake:
Make a sponge in two colours. Then, take
Lots of marzipan too,
Make it square, and then you
Have a nice piece of Battenberg cake!

Cotton strain is a noun, say the polls:
"Feeds primarily on cotton." Poor souls —
Lexicographers, cribbing,
Deserve this round ribbing:
Like the pest, what they thrive on is bolls.

Rebecca (the captain) and Patty
Went to flight school in West Cincinnati.
They'd been called forth to serve
With the Army Reserve
In the clouds and the rat-a-tat-tatti.

Why anastrophe often he chose
In plain speech, he himself only knows.
It was most disconcerting
This order inverting,
And his friends confused more than his foes.

My eye doctor said, "You've a stye,
But don't worry, you surely won't die."
Then he slipped with his shiv—
Should that flub I forgive?
Do you think I should turn a blind eye?

A boardman belongs to the board
Of a firm, such as Boeing or Jord.
His chairman presides
And, at times, overrides
His plans, which the firm can't afford.

You have shared what by right's solely mine.
Pleas for mercy, this time, I decline.
Though you grieve your mistake,
I'll not lodge with a snake.
You shall chamber henceforth with the swine.

To compose a morose epicedium
Can brighten one's torpor and tedium.
I myself have an urge
To create a sad dirge —
One not overly mournful, just medium.

Turning left 'round the elm by the dike,
I hit the big spruce with my bike.
Lost both wheels plus one fender
(Must order from vendor).
Now I'm riding on Junior's old trike.

"The peacemakers, let them be blessed" —
And the Devil may take all the rest.
This famous Beatitude
Offers some latitude,
As Samuel Colt once professed.

"Crizzled glass from the craftsmen of yore —
What a find!" Had I seen this before?
Final sale racks, of course,
At some second-rate bourse:
Glass irregulars, quality poor.

I keep cinnabar moths out in back.
Callimorpha are large, red, and black.
They lay eggs in large batches,
And when the brood hatches,
On leaves of the ragwort they snack.

I ain't smart;  I just can't pass a class.
So, no schoolin' fer me — I'm an ass.
I'm in such a low station,
Can't learn a vocation —
I guess I was born to pump gas.

The tailor was busily sitting
And sewing, his task unremitting,
Since he'd offered his troth
As a man of the cloth
That his suitable suits were befitting.

The worst possible way to arise?
An assault on the nerves, ears, and eyes!
With its smug LCD,
That alarm clock will glee-
Fully see that you unmesmerize.

In Victorian classrooms they sat
In fear of the cane, and of that
Pointed frame — how they dread
Wearing shame on their head:
Oh, the conicalness of that hat!

DEA is a fed institution
In the drug war; it fights distribution
And use.  It could slash
Dealers' access to cash
With a legalization solution.

Said Holmes, "Upon closer inspexion,
I deduce there is no real connexion.
That clue my devoted
Man Watson just noted?
Red herring! It's just a deflexion."

Caught red-handed, she'd give 'em the bounce —
Toss her head, laugh and shrug with a flounce.
"Who, me? My good man,
How absurd!"  That's our gran:
Of remorse, not a shred.  Not an ounce.

It's a word that means "brilliance." The same
Word denotes "acclamation, acclaim,"
Or "a flourish"—aha!
The word is eclat;
One I never have used. That's a shame!

What's to see at a burleycue show?
A display of fine paintings? Well, no.
Still, I'd have to suggest
That a woman undressed
Beats the hell out of any Van Gogh.

When things have been bad, something pleasing
Is a change for the better, or easing.
So, let's get together
In much better weather,
Or share a hot bath when we're freezing.

When I think of Dinichthys, I wish
I could actually catch such a fish,
But this kin of the gar
Is a fossil and far
From a fish for a dish that's delish.

In a galaxy far, far away,
A Jedi-to-be was at play.
But soon he was drawn
To be Palpatine's pawn—
To the attrahent Dark Side he'd stray.

My abode's in the desert; alas,
On lush lawns we sad sand-dwellers pass.
Green blades grew in my yard,
But the sun beat down hard
And destroyed them: old sol's coup de grass.

This chalcid wasp's  larvae eat eggs,
Where they live till they've sipped to the dregs.
Tiny males—wingless, blind—
Will be soon left behind,
For the females get wings with their legs.

My professor described the rotation
Of a beam's plane of polarization.
The Faraday effect
Is its name. (I have checked
And, if needed, can give a citation.)

Here's the scam: make my slam with a wham,
Lots of glam, pots of jam (what a ham).
No surprise, I pull wool
Over eyes. Full of bull,
I'm a master of flimflam, I am.

If blood didn't congeal, but instead
Gushed from wounds in a torrent of red,
First, its pressure would drop,
Then your heartbeat would stop,
After which, pretty soon you'd be dead.

Where seawater's epipelagic,
Thick algae sprout almost like magic.
At a depth of one mile
It's been dark for a while,
And the dearth of fresh flora seems tragic.

A plate of fried eggs over easy
Is addictive, so salty and greasy.
For a little more flair,
Cover up with Gruyère
And this time bomb comes out nice and cheesy.

Cambric tea is the decaf for me:
It's 100% caffeine-free.
First, pour water that's hot,
Wave a bag through the pot,
Then add sugar and milk for weak tea!

The decision was made. Dad was jarred,
As the news kind of caught him off guard.
He was speechless with awe.
Now he can't practice law,
As the truth is: my dad's been disbarred.

"See, we celebrate now Eid al-Fitr."
With not even a trace of a titter,
Thus my new Muslim friend
Spoke of Ramadan's end.
Joked I: "You embrace Eedolf Hitter?"

No sylph, Mae was busty and beamy.
She spoke in tones sultry and steamy:
"In your pocket, ol' son,
Are y' hidin' a gun?
Or are y' jes happy t' see me?"

Theda Bara was known as "The Vamp."
In the silents, Ms Bara was champ
At seducing young men—
Film's first sex symbol!  Then
Tastes evolved and they called her a tramp.

By this word of two meanings I'm struck.
First, a person who's dumb is a cluck.
After that the plot thickens:
This word used by chickens
Is Greek to a goose or a duck.

When he visited one of his aunts,
He would bulbitate (poop in his pants),
But his lovely Aunt Jane
Said, "No need to complain,
As I use it to fertilize plants."

"Son, she lives on the bad edge of town,"
(Meaning border) Dad said with a frown.
"She's no good," Mom agrees.
We're in love, no one sees.
They'll feel bad when the two of us drown.

Competitory? Competitive? Which
Word is better? Just tell me; I'll switch,
As I like being right.
I'll come first, or I'll fight!
Me, competitive? Hah! Man, that's rich!

The game played by clubs called FC
Is football, called soccer by ye
West-pond guys who still claim
That same name for a game
That's mere tohu wa-bohu to me.

Bumped a nest full of hornets at rest,
And the action came fast, unsuppressed.
The response: energetic,
Confused, wild, frenetic.
(The hornets seemed equally stressed.)

Making calamine brass for spittoons,
The medievals bought ore from Walloons.
Cementation with copper
Today is improper.
Back then it made Belgian tycoons.

Bouncy castles are pumped full of air.
One appeared at our church summer fair.
And I told him (the priest),
"Take your shoes off at least:
You can't wear your stilettos in there."

A professional organization
In America, world's leading nation:
Chiefly chemically based
Engineers of good taste
Join up here to promote their vocation.

An affable archer-at-arms
Ate apples, awaiting alarms.
As attacks, all archaic,
Aren't apotropaic,
Any armistice aids ailing alms.

Next-door neighbors remarked, "What a shame!
He's been barhopping — out with a dame?
Though he's found the right block,
This just isn't his lock;
Guess development homes look the same."

After three had departed the ranks,
"Bullet Boob" slyly paid up with thanks
To the starter and said,
"Well, the fastest are dead,
So perhaps you should switch back to blanks."

Steroids of type anabolic
Cause athletes who take them to frolic
On the fields of their game.
But it isn't the same;
What was joy has become melancholic.

All the words that we prefix with circum-
Have a round/about, what is it, quirk, um,
In meaning, that is,
To be circum- — gee whiz! —
Is it "locutory"? (See why I shirk 'em?)

My larder floor's littered with spices
And flour that's been trashed by the mices.
Though critters won't kill me,
With anger they fill me:
My pantry's in rodent-wrecked crisis.

My penultimate GCSE!
Only one more exam, now, for me!
At the age of sixteen
I am free! — What d'you mean
I can't leave for two years? Let me be!

I'm struggling to sort through this stack,
Keeping track of the paint on this rack.
Up I clumsily clamber
Past umber and amber
To track down the black in the back.

When the tenor sang: "Ricco non sono..."
He delivered it con abbandono.
"He was brilliant!" cried Benny,
"But made not a penny."
He'd given the concert pro-bono.

She had said I was handsome and funny,
Started calling me "sweetheart" and "honey".
Then one day I caught on:
It had all been a con!
She beglamoured me — then stole my money.

Dawn is 'frightfully frightfully', yet
Her false manners won't fool you, I bet.
With her hair dyed bright copper,
She tries to act proper,
But 'act' is as good as she'll get.

For a Thanksgiving feast we were meetin',
And we all, on our diets, were cheatin'.
How we gobbled those yams,
Roasted turkeys, baked hams!
In a jiffy the food was all eaten.

Philip Phelps bunked off lectures and missed
Several seminars when he was pissed
At the bar with his buddies —
Fell behind with his studies,
Read no books, but played poker and whist!

Here's a close-up (an intimate view)
Of the babe I intend to pursue.
True, her lipstick's askew,
And her bra strap shows through—
But peruse that outrageous tattoo!

There are times we chastise just for show
Without knowing we reap what we sow.
Is there hope of real gain
If we scold and complain?
If the answer is "No", let it go.

It's so sad Lafayette is unbeddable,
As that strong estafette's  unforgettable.
That equestrian courier —
Handsome, brave warrior —
Fancies just knights. How regrettable!

This lady has Dercum's disease—
Fatty tumors from shoulders to knees
That are causing much pain.
Diagnosis is plain.
Every one of her doctors agrees.

It's a fact that I've known since the crib,
That the clergy are liable to fib—
Saying, "God loves us all",
Or "He'll hear when you call",
Or that women are just a spare rib.

My old cow gave up chewing her cud
Since she started to graze on that crud.
I am sure that those weeds
Are a species that breeds
Her cachaemia—poisons her blood.

While I stared at our second course (curry),
I observed that the currants were furry.
It appeared to be mold—
Which will grow, I am told,
When the currentness goes, in a hurry.

At the Species Bar, here is my gripe:
That, because of conformity's hype,
You will oft hear a boor
Say, "I'm sorry, but you're
Apotypic, not really my type."

Rudy wrote: "Judy's hooters are cute!"
In the bathroom. She thought of a suit,
But although she'd felt rotten
At first, it's forgotten.
Dead and buried, the matter is moot.

Vinca is almost a weed —
It can spread without going to seed.
It's a creeper that sends
Out low runners and tends
To cover your yard with great speed.

My language: it stutters, I stammer,
'Cause I know not so much from it's grammar:
Composition of phrases
Inability raises.
My grammar are all with no glamour.

Mary Ann, you know well there's a name
Folks will use to say, "She is to blame."
So go on, have your fun,
But recall you're the one
Who'll be stuck with the ugly diffame.

Alessandro, the dramatist-furrier,
Sends me drafts of his plays via courier.
Since he writes them on mink
Using watery ink,
They're like Ibsen, I think, but much blurrier.

I'm domestic and house-proud, that's me,
And I serve a fine afternoon tea.
For work that's so vital,
There must be a title—
Ah, domiculture, that's what it be.

When we travelled I knew it would be
Through the mountains, then down to the sea.
Packing boots, strongly made,
And a bucket and spade,
I showed foresight, prepared for a spree!

Did that hunchback, the King, show remorse
When upset by an enemy force?
No, amid all the routing
He ran around shouting,
"My ethnarchy, sir, for a horse!"

Watch a guy first protest, and then holler—
But in vain.  You can bet your last dollar,
There's no more he can say,
'Cause what gives him away
Is a small lipstick smear on his collar.

Agapanthus, the African Lily,
Has blue or white flowers that look frilly.
It means "flower of love".
Well, heavens above,
What's wrong with a rose or a gilly?

Are your nerves feeling frayed, overstraining?
Does it seem like their axoplasm's draining?
Step right up! Try our tonic!
It's hyper-colonic
For nerves: fills 'em up! [May cause staining.]

A dreadnought's a large armored ship;
In the "war to end wars" it was hip.
With its great heavy guns
Our brave nephews and sons
Sent our foes on a bottomward trip.

The well in our yard has been free
Of water since 1903.
We've used it instead
To bury our dead.
It's as bone-dry a place as can be.

That d–mned Caper Merchant, Herr Schmaltz!
At first my Wife thought he'd no Faults.
But a fit of the Vapours
Ensued, for his Capers
Included (O Heavens!) the Waltz.

"Go ye therefore and preach to Creation
The good news that I offer salvation;
Baptize the believers."
(They went—great achievers.)
"I've commissioned you: Teach every nation."

Why is cantaloupe-textured terrain
So unique to this frigid domain?
Will the cavi shed light on
The nature of Triton?
Will pits be the pits to explain?

What do musical fishermen get
From the surf when they first cast a net?
Can they pull from the swells
Clapping ivory shells
For a musical instrument set?

"The meadow is gowaned," said she,
"Bedecked with bright daisies. For free
I'll adorn my old gown
With fresh gowans, and crown
My sweet love as we sport on the lea."

A fine textile fibre, they say,
And a fabric (of flax) in its day.
Now its usage has ceased,
For this meaning at least;
The word byssus is not used this way.

We will always, somehow, have enough.
Thanks to science, we've plenty of stuff:
Cornucopian views
Can inhibit the blues.
If they're wrong, though, the future looks rough.

Fuzz  arrested me (call it "a rest"),
Stopped my heists (so-called  petty-crime fest).
When I ripped off some more,
Got re-busted (a bore!).
I've been pegged "Number One Repeat Pest".

Evil omens say trouble's ahead.
Let me tell you the story of Ted.
Once a mirror he broke
And he thought it a joke.
Two months later we heard he was wed.

Edwin Aldrin, the astronaut, was
In the '60s successful because
Of his famed lunar stroll
(Though that fame took its toll).
Friends and family all know him as "Buzz."

Someone neuter him now, or he'll spawn.
His mentality's that of a prawn.
He's convinced that he knows;
That's as far as it goes—
That holier-than-thou bien-pensant.

Chain of custody we must preserve
To assure we convict this sick perv.
Our strict judge? We'll convince
Her the perp's trail of prints
Is pristine: his defense we'll unnerve.

I accredit the stellar success
Bess enjoyed to her late husband Les.
He had pushed her, indeed,
Every day to succeed.
Clearly Bess without Les is a mess.

Consider the poor thyroid gland.
It is ductless by nature's command.
Round the larynx it's tucked,
But it hasn't a duct.
Hormones enter the blood. Understand?

Your saucy cuisine is outlandish!
You're a casserole Brando might brandish!
These statements I took
From a recipe book:
How to Flatter and Blandish a Bland Dish.

"Almost bedtime," a voice matriarchal
Advises before the stars sparkle.
There's a fading of light
Though it isn't yet night,
And the verb for this process? To darkle.

An expert at poker, the player
Bet stakes made of wood to dismay her.
He shuffled the deck
And inspected her neck:
He was bluffing the vampire slayer.

What is Time?  Can it pause or do shunts?
Well, on that, I confess, I'm a dunce.
Though it does seem to me
Time is so we can be
And stops everything happening at once.

It's an exquisite little device,
That resembles a grinder for spice.
This Liechtenstein treasure
Gives such uncurtailed pleasure
I don't think you will balk at its price.

He was raised in a Cossack domain
In what used to be called the Ukraine.
Each corrupt Russian mogul
Was a target for Gogol.
He described them as Russia's chief bane.

In the White House, chaoticness reigns;
All structure this POTUS disdains.
The disorder he makes
Causes tragic mistakes,
Which with cries of "Fake news!" he explains.

I will not watch a sequel, bar none:
Paranormal Activity 1
Left me haunted and spooked.
That last scene I've rebuked
For its ghostliness. Sleep I now shun.

You may call it a sonnet, although it
Has added-on writing below it.
But your words, I submit,
Must be written to fit
In the format that's set, or you'll blow it,
And reveal you're not much of a poet!

The abducens, a cranial nerve,
Innervates eye muscles with verve.
When you look to the side,
It makes your eyes glide
So you'll see what you want to observe.

For his toothache, Philandering Merv
Applied clove oil to deaden the nerve.
Those botanical drops
Made him numb in the chops,
But they helped get his mind back to 'luurv'.

The Bonneville Salts Flats are vast,
And, for speed records, quite unsurpassed,
As they're empty and flat.
Even better than that:
Cops ignore you, no matter how fast!

The result from a maths-type debate
 For describing the chance that a state
 Will recur, draws on Greek
 Whose words path and work speak
 For ergodic, a word worth the wait.

A small bell made of two metal cones,
The agogo's not used for its tones,
But, percussively, to
Add some style in a few
Latin/African musical zones.

Said my prof at the Language Arts Center:
"Enroll, my dear; register, enter
Our contest for verse
With a very large purse."
But I lost, so I cursed my old mentor.

For appointment TV, I will set
Aside time, trying not to forget
To watch weekly run shows
That I like.  Among those
I can't miss is My Wife, the Corvette.

You're cramping my style.  I can't be
What you want me to be.  I must flee
This inhibitive hold
And create my own mold.
Only then can I truly be free.

Creeping lily—it sounds like a fellow
Might find her in what—a bordello?
She's a glamorous cutie
Of poisonous beauty,
Whose flowers are purple or yellow.

You can choose any book that you fancy —
The Bible, Charles Dickens, Tom Clancy.
Now pick any section,
By random selection,
And your future's just bibliomancy.

The husband and wife might be wed,
But their marriage is virtually dead.
It cannot be patched.
By law they're attached
(But only attached by a thread).

The elderly man is thought whingy
By the landlord, who's known to be stingy.
But with dimly lit hall
That sees no sun at all,
The apartment's depressing and dingy.

A daymare's a fantasy trip,
Like a nightmare by day. Here's a tip:
Shun these horrible dreams,
As they generate screams—
And beware, lest your mind they unzip.

If you knock off of work around five,
Here's two pubs where a guy might revive:
The Frog Hair is fine,
And The Ivy's divine.
But steer clear of The Swan—it's a dive.

From the crowd, loud and clear, in my ear,
That is… yes!…Rule Britannia I hear.
England's cricket team fans
Oft have flags in their hands;
Barmy armies will wave them and cheer.

Our ancestors dealt in perempt-
ory insults and terms of contempt:
Rascal, runagate, varlet,
Rip, cockatrice, harlot …
But dogbolt—now who would have dreamt?

"Jimmy Olsen?" you ask, "'Who is he?"
Photojournalist — new, who you'll see
Pals with Lois and Clark.
Are you still in the dark?
Cub reporter, the Planet, low key.

There's south-eastern Australia beneath
A low shrub one calls cranberry heath.
It has reddish, ripe fruit
With delicious repute:
A sweet treat on the tongue side of teeth.

The  draconian methods  of God,
Though effective, are frightfully odd.
Take Lot's wife; for her fault
She was turned into salt.
How unsavoury! Salt just cures cod!

There once was a girl so capricious
That the boys thought her rather malicious.
She was simply a flirt,
With no notion to hurt—
Her intentions: delicious, not vicious.

There are landlubbers, sorry to note,
Who on shipboard are dumb as a goat;
But my ire hits a pinnacle
When they sit on the binnacle,
Where the compass is housed, on my boat.

"Drink this compound—your bladder's like new,"
My French herbalist swore. It was true.
No more sprints to the john
And the burning's long gone.
Merci, buchu; cystitis, adieu.

In our art class, the pencil's our tool.
On a table we place a high stool
Where a nude gal will sit
Without moving one bit.
(It's my favorite subject at school.)

As each cabra and kid sweetly sleeps,
Chupacabra, the goat-sucker, leaps
Like a 'roo, though reptilian.
See goat throats vermilion
With gore, caprid corpses in heaps.

Apiculturists seldom just die.
When the Grim Reaper calls, they reply:
"Don't be funny, it's sunny
And honey makes money.
Just buzz off yourself, bearded guy!"

In South Africa, Maggie would brag a
Whole lot about bagging a bag o'
Stuff looking like pot.
It was pot that she'd got,
Though in Durban, they call the weed dagga.

When the play begins, that is, at rise,
Those attending are rubbing their eyes.
Though it's called Rated G,
They're astounded to see
All the actors are naked. Surprise!

"The roof ought to cause a sensation,"
Said Rufus, in anticipation
Of 1097.
"They'll think they're in heaven
With Westminster Hall's contignation."

Where the flows of old Scotland run deep,
Ancient selkies and stoor-worms still sleep.
I've walked cold, lonely days
By those boreal bays
And heard wails never vented by sheep.

Some use junk (craving vim like a dervish),
Popping weight pills for figures so curve-ish.
This method's askew,
Your health it will screw;
We can't stay artificially verve-ish.

A hog peanut? Please let me define:
It's the common name used for a vine.
From America — North —
And from Asia comes forth
Amphicarpa, which likes to entwine.

Just what is the OEDILF ambition?
To strive to imbue each submission
With humour and jokes?
But more crucially, folks,
It must give a good definition.

Jack's misdeeds he was careful to hide;
What we thought might be true he denied.
That dark life that he led
Remained hid in his head
When he went to his grave — when he died.

There's this pregnant and overstuffed cell
Who has lately been feeling unwell.
As her final decision,
She opts for division.
The rest is too gruesome to tell!

You're spreading this trash (I've the feeling).
Your calumny's leaving me reeling.
How dare you besmirch
Such a fine name as Birch?
I borrowed those cars; that's not stealing.

My testicular cancer last fall
Is forgotten today as I call
"This is game, set, and match"
To my foe and then catch,
Toss, and serve him my very last ball.

In my window, from centre to base,
Hangs a curtain of netting and lace.
For keeping out bees
And for "kissing the breeze",
This brise-bise is in the right place.

To the gallows, the convict was led,
And a noose was slipped over his head.
The trap door was released.
He cried cockles, that beast!
With a snap of his neck, he was dead.

My determinacy is in doubt:
Does it mean how much life is laid out?
How exact one might get?
How concluded and set?
Definition — that's what it's about.

A fibroma—the tumor I had—
Left me feeling both panicked and sad,
But the doc said, "No issue!
Such tumors of tissue
Connective: benign! Not so bad."

When rhyming that  mask-word anonymous —
The antonymous (flip) side of onymous —
I thought I'd succeeded.
But sadly retreated
On pronouncing, more carefully, ominous.

The Hubble, in sensitive pix,
Spotted Charon, and Hydra, and Nix.
Ever Charon stares in
As 'round Pluto they spin,
In the Kuiper Belt, out in the sticks.

A mothering brisling declared
To a little one, "Don't get ensnared
In the net by the pier."
But the brit didn't hear
For it seems he was herring-impaired.

One of man's diabolical tricks:
Add some brucine to alcohol; mix.
It's denatured—don't drink it,
And don't even think it
Makes sense, or you'll be in a fix!

When Nate married Kate, she was shy.
"I can't cook," she opined, "but I'll try
Using spice to be frisky."
Though loaded on whiskey,
"I taste cumin," he said, "through the rye."

I increasingly fear disgregation:
The loss of our bonds, separation
Of right and of left
That will leave us bereft
Of allegiance we pledge to "one nation".

I am positive! This is no fraud.
That's my charge and I feel oh so flawed.
Oxidation took hold.
An electron got "stoled."
I'm a cation, so help me God!

Oh, you sisters are glowing today!
And those abdomens? Growing, I'd say.
Since you're pregnant, don't fail
To get up on this scale—
Now you're all in the family weigh!

They're chocolaty, nutty, and square,
And in college were fun to prepare.
Marijuana was mixed
In the brownies we fixed.
When we ate them, we floated on air.

Dilettantism pricks like a burr:
A pretentious but rank amateur
(More gourmand than gourmet)
Drinks his ice-cold rosé
And pretends he's a fine connoisseur.

He searched for his Binky and blankie;
Without them, she knew he'd be cranky.
He just stomped and he whined
While she sighed and opined,
"Lover boy, you could suck on my hanky."

He wrote of the city Dodona
And of Zeus and of Enyo (Bellona).
His great innovation
(To create conversation)
Was to add in a second persona.

The Pillars of Hercules rise
Where the Strait of Gibraltar's the prize.
The Calpe food's socko;
In Abila, Morocco,
It's b'steeyas, those sweet pigeon pies.

Get the most out of work! Make it fun!
Your most lucrative jobs will be done
With the helpful advice
(For a very low price)
From my book, which is second to none.

With abstemious, it's vital to see
Moderation is clearly the key
In all eating and drinking.
(And despite my past thinking,
It's pronounced with a very long E.)

Light the barbeque, time for a treat;
The rotisserie's ready for meat.
Use the broach (that's the spit),
And the duck's a good fit.
Get it turning, and crank up the heat.

Deadly sins, against Thebes, come 11,
Wonders, sacraments leading to heaven,
Days in May, brides for brothers,
Grumpy, Doc and five others:
List of things, all preceded by 7.

Here's a masterful cinnamene trick
(But be careful, I've seen a man sick):
Make long chains of this stuff
Till it gets rather tough;
Mold a jar for your cinnamon stick.

In Africa elephants dwell,
With a highly evolved sense of smell:
It's as keen times fourteen
As the best dogs' we've seen.
They detect TNT very well.

She declared, "Someone else loves me true,"
To which he replied, "Good for you!"
She gasped: "Such extolling
Is very controlling."
Amazed, he said, "Who controls who?"

Community service is given
To starlets who sometimes are driven
To commit small offenses.
The judge then dispenses
Tasks meant for a place they don't live in.

As the troops breached the walls of the town,
The King's wife, giving birth, showed the crown.
Said the general, "My Liege,
We have broken the siege,"
And the princeling arrived, upside down.

The capuchin they call yellow-breasted
As a group has been sadly arrested.
That their problems began
With the influx of man
Is a fact that has gone uncontested.

If a med student's noxiously rude,
And perceived by his classmates as crude,
He's got reason to fear
That revenge might be near
As some croton oil dropped in his food.

The mantle the dew worms have worn
Is the glistening mist of the morn.
Now these night crawlers wait
To be fishermen's bait:
They've a date with the hooks they'll adorn.

"Bearing carbon" defines carboniferous;
"Bearing arms" is what's meant by armiferous.
Had this suffix been known
When a manger turned throne,
Might three kings have proclaimed, "We're giftiferous"?

When we bought our new duplex apartment
(Up and downstairs), we thought that's what start meant.
Grandpa's stay brought surprises—
They say hot air rises—
That day we discovered what fart meant.

A blunt instrument's always the best,
As my scattershot actions attest.
I may miss by a mile
With my blunderbuss style,
But the clean-up crew's always impressed.

Forbidden fruit! Does that term ring a bell?
Serpent's ruse worked out ever so well.
Because Eve ate the apple
We all have to grapple
With pain, death, and going to Hell.

The seventy-something spry cow
Took her bull by the horns and asked, "How
Shall we manage to dance
With a splash of romance
If we can't get back up when we bow?"

Oh Master, please do me a favor —
Don't make me do things I don't savor.
Release me, unhand me;
Don't boss or command me;
Don't act like a ruthless enslaver.

Yet more paperwork!  I'd had my fill.
I thought skiing would just fit the bill.
I came here for a break,
And I fell. Now I ache.
Seems my life has just headed downhill.

An illiterate worked in a mine.
Paid by check, tough old Lang "done real fine"
Til he tried to endorse
His first paycheck; of course
They accepted, perforce, old Lang's sign.

I'll go fishing, but here are my terms:
I won't touch any creature that squirms,
You will furnish the boat
And the lines, but take note—
I'll contribute a canful of worms.

"Hey, it's Bjorn, right?  You used to not pay
Any heed to religion."  "Today,
I make calls door to door,
House to house, in God's corps."
"Bjorn, no way!  A Jehovah?"  "Ya, way."

Get a whiff of that three-week-old shad.
Just one sniff and you'll know it's gone bad.
When it's fresh, shad is gray.
Now it's green, sad to say,
And is turning disgustingly plaid.

Rocky spoke with commanding finality:
That was that, not an if, no neutrality.
Then he changed his fool mind,
The whole scheme left behind.
We poor peasants would deal with reality.

The archaeoraptor's a fake—
All it took was adhesive to make
This chimera (it's two
Different fossils and glue).
Took an expert to know it's not jake.

I'm a headhunter, blessed with tenacity,
Seeking skulls with innate perspicacity,
Which I sell to those souls
Wanting cranial bowls
That won't crack when they're filled to capacity.

She's now daggle-tailed, frowsy, a slattern;
Thus her income has dropped—it's a pattern.
She already depends
On the help of her friends.
Well, how much can a whore who's so fat earn?

It's that roll in his gait, you'll agree,
His white ducks and distaste for debris:
Since he crawled from the crib,
By the cut of his jib,
It's been clear that his true home's the sea.

I sat down on the wooden antique
And then painfully let out a shriek,
Shouting something forbidden.
A splinter was hidden
Whose cuspis (its point) gored my cheek.

Many lighting technicians aren't fond
Of that blizzard head. Wow, what a blonde!
Her hair is so light,
If the lighting's not right,
"Flares" shoot out for a foot or beyond.

Son, your thesis is thin. To add clout,
Put meat on the bones, flesh it out.
For your topic, it's vital
To pick a strong title,
Like "Filleting: First Catch Your Trout".

I'm expecting the line's gist below,
For it echoes the line above, so
That the following line,
Above-cited, is fine—
But my eyeballs! They flip to and fro!

"I found an old word, dear: ethereous,"
Said Grandma. "Its meaning's mysterious."
I replied, "Think 'ethereal,'
Like filmy material—
Diaphanous, light and yet serious."

If you look at my eyes there won't be
Any sign of the hole that's the key
To perceiving a view —
There's no pupil, just blue.
Acorea is why I can't see.

A teen who's, like, totally able
To drive his mom's Mercury Sable
Without harming a fly
Just can't wait to defy
An insurer's statistical table.

Since my youth I have had a devotion
To using an ancient pink potion
To soothe itchy bits,
Such as legs, bums, and… It's
A smart choice to use calamine lotion.

To whiten your hairdo with blueing,
It's best that you know what you're doing.
If you add too much dye
It could turn out awry;
Blue hair in the mirror you're viewing.

Caveman Blue (Who thinks up names like these?)
Tastes so good you will drop to your knees.
It has touches of hay,
Beef, and bacon, they say—
Also fruit. Does it still taste like cheese?

An enzyme your bloodstream contains
Helps a hormone to break from its chains.
It's angiotensinase,
Known for dispensin' ace
Vasoconstrictors in veins.

If you're plagued with bold rodents, like moles,
There's a plant that will empty their holes.
Crown Imperial's reek
Will ensure a scared squeak:
One of nature's ingenious controls.

My mother once said, "In a pinch
You should never give athletes an inch,
Or they'll sure take a foot!"
But this question I put:
"Who would want athlete's foot?" (with a flinch).

Had your fill of McCain and Obama,
Yet still craving political drama?
Though you're not the real thing,
Why not wire Beijing:
"Where's my visa, guys? (signed) Dalai Lama."

A young sailor, arrived with his sea bag,
Said: "I hear this hotel gives a free bag
Of gifts to each guest!"
But he later confessed
That the place crawled with pests (yes, a fleabag).

This groggery's been here for years,
And it keeps me in spirits and beers.
Full of low-lifes and drunks,
A few whores and some punks,
It is my kind of bar—it's my Cheers!

There were Texans like Travis who backed it.
Davy Crockett and loyalists packed it.
The defenders were wishin'
The Alamo mission
Would stand, but the Mexicans sacked it.

Andy's tossing this theory about:
Pecan candy Anne can do without.
That's the lie Andy bandies,
Demanding Anne's candies.
"Unhand those damn candies!" I shout.

Fashionistas? They're bashin' and trashin';
For designers they show no compassion.
With no pity for those
Who designed clothes for shows,
These same "clothes-hos" cash in on their fashion.

First-class laundry's the base of my trading:
Whites are gleaming; no colours are fading.
It's all done in China,
Sent back on a liner
Complete with a clean bill of lading.

"Give blood NOW," the advertisement pleads,
"You possess what this dying child needs."
But they turn me away
Just because I'm too gay.
Bloody daft?  Bleeding cruel!  My heart bleeds...

I put every last chip on the red.
Moments later, I wished I were dead
As the croupier's rake
Gathered in my whole stake.
All I've left in my hands is my head.

When you blindly accept and defend,
Then you're drinking the Kool-Aid, my friend.
Philosophically cleaving
And staunchly believing,
You're traveling a road with no bend.

One finds creole-fish widely, they're prone
To love reefs and the ocean's deep zone.
As one of the groupers,
This great little trouper's
As Paranthias furcifer known.

It's no method perfecting one's skill,
But a hand-driven portable drill.
It is held firmly pressed, till
You've bored with your breast drill
A hole with a dowel to fill.

The financial world's gone in the tank,
And I fear going broke. To be frank,
All my dough's in the closet.
I could make a deposit,
But I don't trust the guys at the bank.

The chemistry's wrong (or the stars)
'Twixt us two, and precludes, kind of bars
Much agreement between
Us, as often we've seen.
Our mutual antipathy jars.

Betty bled in the greatest profusion;
Her surviving that wound's an illusion.
Her condition was clear
From the start: death was near.
We all came to that far-gone conclusion.

Here at work, there's a co-op that buys,
In great bulk, all our office supplies.
Ballpoint pens by the ton
When you only need one
May be cheap but, gee whiz, is it wise?

Since "the Poor" were both Christians and Jews,
They held somewhat unusual views:
They kept kosher and all,
But rejected St. Paul,
An approach that put butts in the pews.

When you're trolling for carp, don't complain
If the fish are not biting. Refrain
From all carping and whining;
The day's bright and shining.
Carpe diem — break out the champagne.

All these chores, and you haven't a clue
How you'll manage to ever get through.
But don't get overheated:
Once each task's completed,
It's done and no longer to do.

Inflorescence of betony towers
Two feet above lowlier flowers;
Each bract in the spike
Is bright crimson; bees like
Their lobed calyces—fewer flight hours!

The caterer said, "It's in vogue—
From this fountain will wine disembogue,
As your guests fill their glasses."
But it drips as wine passes,
And it stains all their clothes. He's a rogue.

If you're chary of words when you speak,
Such terse language—which some might find bleak—
Offered softly and slow,
Gains attention, and so
Granting less is a splendid technique.

Acetic anhydride will start
Acylation of morphine, the heart
Of the chemical switch
Of the compounds by which
We make heroin.  Easy and smart.

Here's a list of the dances I know:
The Watusi, the Cotton-Eyed Joe,
The waltz, carioca,
Fandango, and polka.
(Six down and a million to go.)

Not to curtsy was surely a slip,
One that could have been eased with a quip;
But her escort, she'd find,
Sadly, wasn't that kind —
"Way to go, cherie," curled off his lip.

Angleberries: nice fruity treats?
Not unless you think warts are good eats.
Quoting competent sources —
"With cattle and horses:
On lips and ears, udders and teats..."

An Anglican chum of my mum's
Is so clumsy, we say when he comes:
"It's the maladroit minister,
Trés ambisinister.
Left hand or right, he's all thumbs."

What's CH? The Swiss whole, sliced like cheese
Into 26 cantons; and these
Law- and tax-wise determine,
In Italian, French, "German",
And Romansh — strangely not Cantonese.

In part four of his classical speech,
Which took him two hours to reach,
Came Al Gore's confutation
Of hope for this nation,
Refuting what talking heads preach.

Once cadent meant falling, like tears.
Now the language has changed, switching gears;
And the word now describes
Something giving out vibes
With a rhythm one readily hears.

A coder was losing his wits:
"This program is giving me fits!
It'll take me a while,
But I must decompile
To make sense out of all of these bits."

How shall you get the most out of you —
Exploit your skills fully?  It's true
You just love to recline;
So with that I'll opine
You'd best mattress-test, son — get paid too!

As a youngster high mountains I'd climb,
Where the views from the top were sublime.
Now the foothills I trek
With a crick in my neck:
From low hills I look up all the time.

Here's cane with a four-part agenda:
A stem that's both hollow and slenda;
A rod used for hidin';
A stick when you're stridin';
A grass yielding sugar, not Splenda.

Wimpy Hill is a ski slope so slight,
With a few inches snowfall at night,
This declivous low mound
May seem nowhere around
In a search by the morning's first light.

Over there—see the gorgeous young Claire?
All those tightly wound springs are her hair!
Lovely curledness! Wait—
Claire's fair hair is her fate.
When it's tangled she'd better beware!

Bill and Sue got caught up in amour-dom.
He was hers and she so much adored him.
But fourteen months after —
They ran out of laughter;
They'd nothing in common but boredom.

Beleaguered, a lion denied
His own hunger and tried to provide
For his litter of cubs,
But they withered like scrubs,
So he quit and just swallowed his pride.

Battle bravery—soldiers revere it.
War is hell, but the bold need not fear it.
Even caught, skinned alive,
Shot, or maimed, you'll survive
If the enemy can't break your spirit.

Conscription's a word for the draft.
I react, being given the shaft,
Like the ancient Egyptian
Who wrote this inscription:
"Fight Hittites? Build tombs? Man, you're daft!"

Cinderella, rewritten for rubes,
Rated "R", will go straight down the tubes.
You can blame Warner Brothers
For the Fairy Godmother's
Bare bibbidi-bobbidi-boobs.

"I've decided I must disenthrone
Moe, my husband," cried Joan, with a groan.
"Though it's sure to unnerve him,
I'll no longer serve him—
Of late, his affairs are well known."

An "elliptical" shape is in reach
Of the leaves born by dogwood or beech.
"Oval-lance-shaped" is found
In between long and round;
And leaves "lanceolate"? Willow or peach.

A succession of crimes is a crime spree.
This last batch of rhymes is my rhyme spree.
Since my rhymes involve sex
And are all rated "X",
My dear wife says my rhyme spree's a slime spree.

No two Cabbage Patch Kids are the same,
And each one of them has its own name.
These Coleco-made toys
Were for girls and for boys.
They brought Xavier Roberts great fame.

I store plasma and tissue and pee,
And I serve as a kind of trustee
For samples so rare
That they need special care.
I'm a biobank—run for a fee.

She's the woman I'd most like to join,
Soul to soul, heart to heart, loin to loin.
She will soon be my spouse
And we'll build us a house.
In my palace of life, she's the coign.

They are killing each other.  Look! There!
Yes, there, too.  There, as well.  You know where.
And they kill in the name
Of the God they acclaim
With Kalashnikov-clamorous prayer.

Let's play board games — such innocent fun!
I think Cluedo's my favourite one.
We'll ask questions until a
Good guess gives the killer—
Mrs White, in the hall, with the gun.

In a prison escape, it adds glamour
When a gunfighter's fanning his hammer.
With the trigger removed,
Speed of firing's improved.
(How'd that handgun get into the slammer?)

We'll go to Torino this year,
Where I'll watch the biathlon and cheer
For the skiers who shoot,
As my wife spends my loot
In buy-athlons by shopping for gear.

Said a monk, "Though the solids win praise,
It's the liquids that truly amaze.
I'm completely impressed,
For this curd cheese is blessed.
God works in mysterious wheys."

Arthur Aardvark adored ABCs;
Builder Bob bolted boards bought by bees;
Canine Clifford chewed clogs;
Darling Dora digs dogs;
Ernie's Duckie complains; Bert agrees.

They watched me with mild disbelief
As my summary lagged, to their grief
(I was using their time).
So they griped, "It's a crime—
We'd like a brief briefer, you thief!"

Here we're dancing around a sombrero.
Cupid aims and lets loose with an arrow.
Her eyes dance with delight.
I don't know, but it might
Be some ocular form of bolero.

A decipherer's challenged to take
An unreadable code and to make
It a readable text,
But they sometimes are vexed
By a message they just cannot break.

That's a very nice suit; do not spoil it.
If you defecate now, you will soil it.
There's an urge you'll suppress
For avoiding the mess,
But the problem is finding a toilet.

The ghosts on an old TV set
Were just duplicate signals, and yet
I am sure there were those
Who immediately froze,
And cried, "Momma! It's Auntie Annette!"

In O'Mallory's pub at last call,
Sean was smashed and he started a brawl.
"Oh, feck!" shouted Finn,
As the roof collapsed in
When he crashed through a main bearing wall.

Quoth the bishop: "You'll question your flock,
Then you'll wait for their answers. Don't mock!
To review, you'll ask why
God's not just in the sky —
Thus you'll catechise all as you talk."

Though it's spicy and hot and I worry
That, after I eat it, I'll hurry
Away to the loo
As it passes on through
Into poo, still I do favor curry.

In a band on a stage is a loon
Who is blowing his blasted bassoon—
Uninhibited, cute,
But so tin-eared he'll toot
With abandon, forsaking the tune.

So ya wanna move up in the Mob
And take over Il Capo's own job?
Then just put out a contract
To get the old Don whacked.
But you'll need a new name—trust me, Bob.

With a fondling-the-flex-of-the-mic tic,
She said women were ick, but she liked ick.
Adding "Your ick would do...",
She gave her point of view;
And to speak from that stance makes this deictic.

When Abebe Bikila's great race
At the '60 Olympics took place,
There were thousands who gazed
On this wonder, amazed —
He ran barefoot with consummate grace.

Shelly wasn't hurt bad, thank the Lord.
When her parents found out, they were floored.
They had her committed
But must have omitted
To get her consenting accord.

A degenerate failure surprise,
Chandrasekhar was first to surmise
That collapse happens fast
When a limit's surpassed:
A white dwarf has a maximum size.

Kinetics, if  chemical, tell
Us how long it will take till we smell—
Using noses as testers—
The products, like esters,
Once acid and booze are mixed well.

I took my new gal to the zoo.
Now I feel like a cast-off old shoe.
Her complaints never ceased,
"You are just a wild beast!"
Then she promptly ran off with a gnu.

Her fantasy never was idle,
And her thoughts sometimes turned homicidal,
As her boyfriend would balk
When of weddings she'd talk.
When she spoke of a bridal, he'd bridle.

If you're jaded and feel in the mood
To relax for a week with your brood,
A dude ranch might just serve
To replenish your nerve —
Horseback riding, new friends and good food!

When a lens grinder fell from the shelf,
Here's the way we described Santa's elf:
"Butterfingered" — because
This subordinate Claus
Made a spectacle out of himself.

At the cusp of a wave sits a ship;
Then it lowers its bow in a dip.
At the cusp of one's fame
People may know one's name,
And the cusp of an arch is its tip.

"Ice cream sam'wich," said 5-year-old Nellie
To the counterman working the deli.
But her mom countermanded
The order, and handed
Her 5-year-old crackers and jelly.

As a rigger, my place is divine,
In the flies, amid batten and line.
Though I risk life and limb
Flying backdrop and scrim,
After curtain time, flies are cloud nine.

Are your gilts badly swollen with garget?
Are the conchs on the Rock hooking margate?
From sick pigs to grey fish,
My chimerical wish
Is to master all manner of argot.

I hear Amazon plans to use drones
To deliver (in various zones)
Its merchandise fine
That folks purchase online —
From me this elicits just groans.

Your gallbladder concentrates bile,
Then stores it for use in a while.
When you eat fat or grease,
Then the stored bile's release
Will facilitate forming of chyle.

I purchase a thoroughbred horse;
He's the fastest I've seen at the course.
Then I race him a lot,
But he doesn't win squat,
So I'm suffering buyer's remorse.

Stan the handyman's never been blue.
A fantastic, he's strange through and through.
Still, however bizarre
He seems, Stan should go far.
It's been whispered he drives a smooth screw.

The fossil hounds digging around
For remains of old trees in the ground
Thought the Metasequoia
Extinct, but oh boy, a
Dawn redwood, in China, was found.

Your hammerstone strike is applied
To a core stone and, as they collide,
You get stone-blade construction
(Through lithic reduction),
And debitage — chips cast aside.

We investors—a sad bunch of chumps—
All want profits, but only get lumps.
CEOs skim off cream,
Which amounts to this scheme:
They're on top, we remain in the dumps.

These convergent devices save space;
Many gadgets crammed into one place.
Now it's all on my phone,
So I live "in the zone,"
And my life's not my own. What a pace.

When I went to the shop to buy beans,
All the buttons popped off my new jeans.
"Lady, lima or navy?
For soup or for gravy?"
"String or snaps for my waist, by all means!"

Attention, you moms with ambition:
The Junior Miss World Competition!
We'll strut your pre-teenies
On stage, in bikinis.
"Eroticize kids!" — that's our mission.

When I first heard the phrase blue sky laws,
I admit that the term gave me pause.
They're not laws about flying,
But the issue and buying
Of securities—every last clause.

Deserpidine, got from the roots
Of Rauwolfia shrubs (not their fruits)
Serves, as some sources mention,
To reduce hypertension
Or to tranquilize fidgety brutes.

The chattering classes opine,
Often toeing the left-leaning line.
They've articulate views
About what's in the news.
If the right gets its way, hear 'em whine.

My mouth has gone terribly dry;
My saliva has bid me goodbye.
You will pardon the nihilism,
But I'm facing aptyalism—
Can't spit, and afraid I will die.

I'm a farm boy from Boise and I
Favor raspberry hues, but I try
To sound French and urbane,
And not pastoral-plain,
By exclaiming "framboise!" — and that's why.

To construct geometrically, use
Both an edge and a compass to fuse
Sweeping arcs and straight lines
For specific designs,
Taking care with the shapes that you choose.

This geometry textbook provides
A solution that helpfully guides
As I take my exam.
"What's a chiliagon?" "Ma'am,
It's a figure with one thousand sides."

My elevator man likes to preach:
He uplifts me each day with a speech.
We both share the desire
For climbing up higher
To places we'd each like to reach.

Oh boy, am I down in the dumps!
My ardor for politics slumps.
Why I'm low? I'll be terse:
Just whose character's worse —
Is it Hillary Clinton's or Trump's?

They divorced, with a custody battle
So intense it would make your teeth rattle,
Where they seemed to make bids—
Set a price for their kids—
Like an auction for horses or cattle.

Our new home deal fell through when we checked
Out the pond — the last thing to inspect.
It was overgrown, stunk,
Full of slime-coated junk:
The detritus of years of neglect.

It's a hubbub, a brouhaha. Cowed?
It'll join any anapest crowd.
Need an end-rhyme? Ta-daa!
It becomes brouhaha.
And brouhaha is also allowed.

With an approbatory expression,
You sanctioned my writing obsession.
Now you think it's a curse
That I've settled on verse
As my 24/7 profession.

Corticosterone's something they take
From your cortex (adrenal) or make—
A synthetic from labs.
If it strengthened the abs,
It would be in my strawberry shake.

Although folks like to make a connection
Between him and caesarean section,
Caesar came to this earth
Via vaginal birth;
So say experts by way of correction.

Dim-witted means 'dense', but — surprise!
The same doesn't pertain to the eyes.
Dim-sighted (near blind)
Doesn't speak of your mind,
But your vision. (A word to the wise!)

Boil up sugar, some syrup and water.
Stir in peanuts. Then surely you oughter
Add butter. Now fizz —
Baking soda, that is —
Brings embrittlement. Pour it, my daughter.

Though the surgery's done with great skill,
Anesthesia can make folks feel ill,
So their surgeons are cautious.
For folks who feel nauseous,
Droperidol's just the right pill.

My appetites, dear, are edacious,
Whether meat, drink or sex—I'm voracious.
And with vigour afresh,
I will gorge on all flesh
(It's a good thing my pants are capacious).

My band is called Slurpee Disgrace;
We have groupies, but we wear the lace.
And 'tis I keeping time,
For there's no doubt that I'm
A guitarist of bass, and I'm base.

The columniform trunks of these trees
Form a high-vaulted temple. One sees
In this forest a solemn
Repose, as each column
Brings calm that one enters with ease.

My advice, while I live on this earth,
To all ladies is, give a wide berth
To men who are sweaty,
With hair like a yeti
That covers an oversized girth.

What's fuzzy is cuddly and tickles;
What's echinulate's covered in prickles.
Yet my hedgehog's not horrible
As a pet: she's adorable.
Look, somebody slept with Don Rickles.

You were honest and truthful, I thought,
So I loaned you the boats that you sought.
I'll articulate charges
For sinking my barges;
You'll pay what the court says you ought!

"I hope that Obama will fail,"
Said Rush Limbaugh.  Remember the wail
From the very same press
Who wish Trump no success,
Who, against him, relentlessly rail?

Listen, Thomas. Your spelling is wrong.
No, the period doesn't belong.
When you're writing, it's dot-com
Since dot.com it's not, Tom.
Support for that hyphen is strong.

Ol' Churchill knew just what to do
When it looked like his country was through.
"We shall never surrender,"
Said Blighty's defender.
"Instead, we shall fight World War II."

In full flow, I proceeded to plead
That my client was blameless; no need,
For he cried, "I confess!"
In the light of this mess,
I proceeded to promptly decede.

I'm stuck with a habit quite funny.
I chat with my friendly pet bunny.
My wife in dismay,
As we rabbit away,
Says, "That's anthropomorphism, honey".

The boat's bottom is sloped, but not much.
In the shallows it has the right touch.
I will early from bed rise,
Take my Chesapeake deadrise,
And catch crabs or dredge oysters and such.

At the closing bell, check out my gains;
Stocks are up! Caviar and champagne's
On the menu for dinner —
See my ten-bagger winner?
(Psst. Tomorrow they'll beat out my brains.)

When the first killing frost fell last night,
My tomato vine shrunk from its might.
Now a black withered blastie,
Cells blasted and nasty,
The vine weeps its last at first light.

My three fashion plate daughters love style;
What's in vogue that's in Vogue makes them smile.
They inhale trendy news;
For this month, it's chic shoes.
Just their biweekly "do"s cost a pile!

The Argentine plays the bandoneon
(First German, but now Patagonian).
Buttons left, buttons right,
In and out, through the night—
A beginner's a pure Pandemonian.

He is eight years of age and loves chess;
I can beat him most days, I confess.
But at meets at his school
He's the champ, as a rule,
And his confidence soars with success.

If you've had it with skins that are light,
Hate them all, and consider them blight,
You may have some issues
With others' skin tissues
And soon you'll be called antiwhite.

You say you've "forgotten", my pet,
All those things that I asked you to get?
Then, please, feel at leisure:
To wait is my pleasure.
Mañana, don't hurry, no sweat!

When you loudly progress up a street
In the junkiest heap of your fleet,
And it's  chortling—the cop
Wants it fixed at a shop,
Or you'll have to rely on your feet.

Da da dah, da da dah, da da dah.
Da da dah, da da dah, da da dah.
Da da dah, da da dah.
Da da dah, da da dah.
Da da dah, da da dah, da da dah.

My coral bells' summer's begun,
All their fairy-like blossoms such fun.
(An old song says they're ringing
When fairies are singing.)
Coral-bright, how they swing in the sun!

Though the paintwork is fresh, white and new,
Detractingly, not so the blue
Velvet curtains, which, faded
And shabby, degraded,
Take away from the decor, it's true.

Algebraic equations have roots,
And these numbers are frequently beauts.
Every one is a peach,
But that pi's out of reach.
Are we speaking of math or of fruits?

Contraceptive? It's known as the "birth pill."
That's implying, for what it is worth, Jill,
That that evening in May
With our roll in the hay
Means of rugrats we'll still have a dearth, Jill.

An épicerie's really a deli,
But French-er; the cheeses are smelly,
The confit is ducky,
And those who are lucky
Can buy escargots canned in jelly.

Bringing evidence forward at trial,
My attorney pulls pix from a file,
Which conclusively show
I was cruising the Po
When that bastard was stabbed on the Nile.

With dysphemia, when trying to utter,
It's quite certain you'll stammer and splutter,
And  falter and pause.
And it also will cause
A r-really embarrassing stutter.

It's a New Age placebo, I'm sure,
But the real doctors say there's no cure
For the cancer I've got,
So I thought, "Hey, why not?"
Crystal therapy has some allure.

As a chef, I employ elixation
To further meat's tenderization:
Bring beef to a boil,
Let it simmer, not roil—
That's my plan to ensure salivation.

When you say he is flaunting the rules
You are falling between the two stools.
The person you're taunting
Is actually flaunting
His freedom by flouting them, fools!

Not too often (I'd say it's occasional),
I'll use arguments clearly equational:
"And that's why, you see,
A is equal to B!"
All the math majors find these persuasional.

If you sweat but your showers are fewer—
Won't do squat with the carpet shampooer—
If you purge what you downed
As you piddle around—
Body waste won't be found in your sewer…

Being sure that the river was fordable,
Jim eschewed the small ferry (quite boardable);
But the swift current, swirling,
Sent poor Jimmy hurling.
The Times found his rescue recordable.

Many arrow loops set in the wall
Of his castle, with archers on call
To the will of their liege,
Made it likely a siege
Wouldn't cause the earl's castle to fall.

The baroscope's old and outdated.
It balanced two metals, each weighted
A different way,
With one hollow, so they
Moved a bit when air pressure abated.

In catharsis, emotions will pour
From your soul, through each window and door.
You may laugh, you may cry,
And not even know why,
And keep on till you can't any more.

Said the Prez, "Our economy's trending
To recession.  We see it descending.
So my stimulus pitch
To get out of this ditch?
Let's engage in some deficit spending."

At the foot of my grave lies a stone.
It explains why I'm here all alone.
It's a fitting memorial
And useful tutorial:
DON'T DRIVE WHILE YOU'RE USING THE PHONE.

If allergies give you the hump,
Don't go scratching that blister or bump.
Rub in cortisone cream;
It will work like a dream
To soothe both the itch and the lump.

A farmer said, "Son, enough talk.
Grab an axe and go slaughter that cock."
Timmy turned a green hue:
"Dad, I can't doodle-do
This grim task. I'm a chicken; I balk."

Viewing artwork is what he enjoys,
As a guard the museum employs.
He'd be better, he's sure,
Than their art connoisseur,
If they'd give him some art to connoisse.

At a boxing event held last night,
Bob exhausted his foe. What a sight:
All worn out, drenched with sweat,
But that's just what you get
With a 50-round heavyweight fight.

A unique phycomycete may seek
To make prospects for cucumbers bleak.
That soft watery rot's
From a fungus—those spots
Are foretokens of cottony leak.

A circular opening's right
For the passage of air or of light.
It might be an oval.
One over a stove'll
Make kitchens, once dark, very bright.

If a beggar, with keen aspiration,
Were to ask for a rich, warm location,
You'd hear me suggestin'
"Head south and work Destin —
A panhandler's dream destination!"

An arbor, free standing, with view:
One entrance (you cannot walk through).
While the pergola frame
Might appear much the same,
It's a "covered way" — entrances two.

In Las Vegas, casinos don't gamble:
They know that the customers scramble
To see a big name.
It just isn't the same
When the floor show is Rush or Glen Campbell.

I've an exanthematic disease;
It's contagious with symptoms like these:
Weakness, fever, and lots
Of small, itchy, red spots;
So I sweat and I scratch and I sneeze.

Capybaras will eat their own poo —
That's what auto-coprophagists do.
It's a clever device:
They consume the grass twice,
Gaining protein the second time through.

Dropping coins in the box, people say,
"When that violin's played, we will pay."
But while faces were turned,
Someone stole what was earned,
So the fiddler was fiddled that day.

Nigel said he was looking to get
Him a fag.  I approached him.  "No sweat,"
I then told him.  "I'm gay."
But he screamed, "Go away!
All I want is a damn cigarette!"

Now with apospory, ferns and some mosses
Have some diploids that show who the boss is.
Gametophytes issue
From sporophyte tissue
Directly! No spores! This their loss is.

Your new boyfriend's been charged with some crimes
But they're basically nickel-and-dimes.
Seems the thing he does best
Is resisting arrest.
He's been featured on Cops fifteen times.

This fruit machine's robbing me blind:
Dials spin, but no win can I find.
It is driving me nuts,
But I haven't the guts
To risk missing three cherries aligned.

Angiocardiogram? I suppose,
Since I've seen radiology pros.
They're injecting some dye
In a vein in my thigh,
And then watching to see where it goes.

Watching Trinity, holding my breath,
Now I've blood on my hands, like Macbeth.
Though I muttered, It worked,
Still, a darker thought lurked:
The destroyer of worlds, I am death.

A bumpkin draftee, name of Bill,
Did surprisingly well up until
Sarge yelled, "Hold your gun steady";
Then, not, "Fire when ready" —
Instead he barked, "Fire at will!"

Greta makes her own feta (and Brie).
It's far better than store-bought to me.
With her goat-milk cheese done,
She'll announce just for fun,
"Greta's feta's a fait accompli."

The bilge pump is broken I think,
As the boat is now starting to sink,
But I'm bailing out water
So fast that I oughta
Just keep myself out of the drink.

Want to greet an old pal in Belize?
Guys don't meet with a hug or a squeeze.
They just interlock thumbs,
And with that greeting comes.
It's as cool as a tropical breeze.

At the sight of my hawk soaring higher,
Poor pigeons take fright, and expire.
My prize falcon-gentil
Is unsentimental,
Despite what they call her — a "cryer".

Shake our dirt from your feet— leave today!
Wear your traveling shoes—do not stay!
Wave goodbye to your friends,
For your sojourn here ends.
We dister you; we drive you away.

Listen: "clank", higher: "clink", lower: "clunk"—
Even  "clonk"—while you drink, or get drunk—
They're all sounds of impacting
Hard things interacting,
Like a plank, pots of ink, or a trunk.

When I wanted to marry Sophía,
She was dead set against the idea.
So much so, on the day
I proposed, she turned gay,
Changed her name, and ran off to Korea.

That Arabian camel whose hump
Was the size of an elephant's rump—
Since her last liposuction
(Elective reduction)
It's down to a lemon-sized lump.

It's a word that denotes depravation,
Bringing downward, with ego deflation.
I speak of embasement:
Descending displacement
To reach an inferior station.

See, the thing about hedgehogs and snails
Is in heat, their efficiency fails.
So they use aestivation
Which is like hibernation
But reversed; they skip summer's travails.

Five rugs for five bucks!  What a deal!
Baghdad-shopping for Graham's quite a steal.
Now I'm sold on the war
'Cause I know what it's for:
It's to carpet Graham's home.  How surreal!

Do you see all this water that's rushing
Away? I can't stop it from gushing.
This sure ain't no joke;
My W.C.'s broke—
And I just cannot stop it from flushing!

Ted's deference—that was my referent,
When I said he is overly deferent.
He is much too submissive.
His peers are derisive
As he searches for service that's preferent.

Couch potato and sofa match well.
Both are old and beginning to smell.
They are dressed pretty shabbily,
Sag fairly flabbily:
Slack muscles and springs, I can tell.

Hello, little cell, how are you?
I am thinking of changing your hue.
If you're different from others,
Your cellular brothers,
You may find yourself turning bright blue.

"This diamond," she said, "I was dazed
By the size of it — really amazed!
But it's now become clear
What you think of me, dear:
In the meantime, I got it appraised."

It's true other runners won't thwart us,
Though our speed might suggest rigor mortis.
If our progress is steady
For success we'll be ready —
A lesson that Aesop once tortoise.

There once was a Doric stonecutta
Whose adornments sent ladies aflutta.
He said, "I can't trust 'em
To fondle my frustum."
(Get your mind, baby, out of the gutta.)

In your throat, near the larynx, there juts
The cricopharyngeus.  "What's
A cryco-...?"  you ask.
It's a muscle. Its task:
Muscle morsels much nearer your guts.

The teen and her parents consented;
All parties concerned were contented.
These consentient three
Absolutely agree.
One or more of them must be demented.

I was only a private first class
With a healthy disdain for the brass.
Did ectopia cause
All my officers' flaws,
Each one born with his head up his ass?

You just don't understand the potential
Of this, the new Ford Presidential.
Bells and whistles?  Not true!
Leather seats (kangaroo)
That will vibrate are clearly essential!

Moshe tore up his cultural roots.
Being German, he reasoned, best suits.
But the Waffen-SS
Called him "Jew" nonetheless,
And he died hanging up by his boots.

At the outset, He got underway
With His work, but not long did He stay.
Without breaking a sweat
In the dark, He said, "Let
There be light," and then called it a day.

The 'restructuring' talk was a lie.
I've to leave, and I'm wondering why
I was placed on the list
To let go.  I'm dismissed
As redundant, and soon I shall cry.

Those fungi that grow inside roots?
Endotrophic: with roots in cahoots.
The opposite kind
Pays the inside no mind —
Ectotrophic, they've outside pursuits.

There's a bar, Subatomic, I know
Where all the best particles go.
But it seems I've a jinx—
When I try to buy drinks
For electrons, they always say "no."

An auxiliary force is a corps
That assists when a nation's at war.
Though these foreigners make
Savvy soldiers, they take
A few months to establish rapport.

"I have written a tune, 'Santa, Sleigh It,'
For the stage. They want you to OK it.
I insist: do not change it."
"I'll only arrange it
To allow twelve musicians to play it."

A factor that's causatively rated
Is an input that someone has stated
Will provoke an effect.
But beware — don't expect
That connection to go undebated.

Hello Canada, now we are seven;
The first meeting here's warmer than Devon.
Pierre Trudeau can join
As we strive for the coin
That will buy us our monetary heaven.

Here's Aeaea, the Island of Dawn,
Where Odysseus brandished his brawn
In a battle with Circe.
Removing her curse, he
Turned swine back to men and was gone.

While conforming to standards, persist
In adhering to what's on the list.
Follow rules and abhor
All uniqueness since you're
A conventional—orthodox—ist!

Should you happen to step on an ant,
An apology then you should grant.
If he could respond
From beyond the beyond
He'd be likely to rant, but he can't.

Is she lost? What, again? Cousin Fern
Seems completely unable to learn
How to reach Grandma's door.
You go straight up Route 4,
Then you dog leg—you make a sharp turn.

We are French revolutionaries! We're
Equal citizens now. If you care
About liberty, then
Citoyen/Citoyenne
Is the way we'll address you, mon cher.

"For the cook, carriage driver, and maid,
He's the boss—has it made in the shade,"
Writes the hack.  Next the butler
Consults with the cutler
To buy an untraceable blade.

Never shy when approaching a dame,
Dave moves forwardly, taking good aim.
Should she say he's too bold,
He won't quit; he won't fold.
Free of shame, he'll continue the game.

"You were great. You're too good to ignore,"
Said DeMille. "You were simply top drawer!"
Then his picture debuted:
I'm cut out. I'm so screwed.
I was left on the cutting room floor.

Clever Eli aspired to knowing
The deep secrets of stitching and sewing.
How excited was he,
Sly inventor-to-be—
In his brain, fertile seeds began growing.

The Dendrocolaptidae birds
Are woodcreepers; both useful words
Which, if you're in the know,
Make it easy to show
You're an expert, not one of those nerds.

I sipped at my warm Chardonnay
As I sucked on a limp crudité,
And decided the Devil
Had catered this revel.
Next course: rubber chicken. Oy vay!

The lead back-broken jackass said,  "Nay!
No more loads will we carry today.
From this back-breaking work
After 5 we shall shirk —
God willing. So mules, let us bray."

As a geocacher, Georgie will read
Geographical markers that lead
To where he is bidden
To find something hidden.
With GPS help, he'll succeed.

Treating symptoms, not causes, to some,
Is what medicine's sadly become.
Haven't pooped for a while?
Chew on Ex-Lax—and smile!
That's allopathy's style, and it's dumb.

Take an F and an L, and then mesh
'Em with E, S and H, for a fresh,
Fragrant term we can greet
(By the way, it means "meat").
Now you know how the word was made: flesh.

Gaston Phelppes was a chef of renown,
And 'e 'ad ze best restaurant in town,
Till a guy from Zagat
Was served rat. Though low-fat,
That was that. The next day he closed down.

All ye who would enter this place
Must anapest meter embrace.
If you do, you're a poet.
Wear this badge—proudly show it.
"OEDILFer", it says—"mental case".

Copyrightable work of your brain?
So you say, but your claim is in vain.
We all know the tale
Of the girl and the pail;
It's now in the public domain.

If you're fabless, you don't have a fab,
Just develop designs in your lab.
You are not the constructors
Of your semiconductors.
You outsource that job, pay the tab.

At a gas station people buy glue,
Light bulbs, hairspray, pens, cans of beef stew,
Fan belts, dice, floor wax, Cheetos,
Pink frozen burritos,
And videos.          (...gasoline, too.)

I'm a fault-finder, stern and exacting.
I find sloppiness dumb and distracting.
You'll find that I'm nice
When you're sharp and precise.
If you're not, and I am, then I'm acting.

Ragusa's, or Dubrovnik's, fame
Are the ramparts surrounding the same.
Huge walls still encincture
This place, a clear tincture
Of traders' once powerful claim.

A barostat's job is it keeps
Even pressure in planes or in peeps.
While the structure will sense
When your blood gets more dense,
The device measures air as it seeps.

"I'm upset with reports I have read,"
Don Vincente displeasedly said.
"It is clear your work sucks."
I was fined fifty bucks,
Then he shot me three times in the head.

The boxer Muhammad Ali,
World heavyweight champion times three,
Was as deft as his quote
On his fighting style: "Float
Like a butterfly, sting like a bee."

I'm just five and it's well understood
I'd eat cookies all day if I could.
Mommy says she will bake
Me a big chocolate cake.
Just deserts will be mine if I'm good.

I'm still able to learn, not too old
Nor too stiff to allow any mold
To take hold, and won't nix
Some new concepts or tricks.
I'm adaptable, on this I'm sold.

The production was lacking in zest;
With the acting, I wasn't impressed;
The music and lighting
Were both unexciting.
"Amateurishness" sums it up best.

To make dresses or shirts, you could buy
Yards of chambray for summer. Rely
On a weft that is white.
When the warp-color's bright,
It's a fabric you may want to try.

The agony aunt sucks her pen,
And mutters "Oh Lord, tell me when
Will these virgins like "Midge" and all
Ask an original
Question? (I'll just count to ten.)"

When a person is distant, he'll say
Very little; and tempers may fray
When, with no explanation,
He shuns conversation—
His mind set to far, far away.

A collapsar's a gravity whisk;
On approaching, you run a great risk
That your atoms will flow
In a gamma-ray glow
And accrete in a spiraling disk.

On the Nile, you are likely to see a
Graceful sailboat. I'm sure you'll agree a
Lovely picture 'twill make,
If a snapshot you take
Of the boat that folks call dahabeeyah.

Try a pure cotton candlewick spread,
Soft and warm, to enhance any bed.
The wavy design
Is a classic, but mine
Has a waffle-style texture instead.

Your endearing sweet chuckles and yelps
Make me think that you must be a Phelps!
You're delightfully funny
With your hair dripping honey.
You don't have to be mad but it helps.

A chaise is two-wheeled transportation,
Good to choose when you need recreation,
For it's drawn by a horse,
And for sweethearts, of course,
Could provide some romantic elation.

No more sidestepping, this time you're stuck.
As a leader, let's face it, you suck.
It's too late; the milk's spilt,
So face up to your guilt.
Accept blame; don't denounce some poor schmuck.

Cousin Alice feels safe and serene
When she's hooked to this wondrous machine
Undergoing dialysis.
Here's her analysis:
"Treatment will keep my blood clean."

We've been eager to party and drink,
But the tap on the keg's on the blink.
So it's soda, not beer—
Nothing's happening here.
Kinda sadder Budweiser, I think.

On the waterfront, owners were greedy
For freighters whose loading was speedy.
What made longshoremen know
They'd been going too slow?
Coulda been a container ship, Edie.

My request for adoption assistance
From my boss had encountered resistance.
"It ought to be stopped,
This help to adopt,"
Said that skinflint, who loathed its existence.

When young Neptune was told "clean your room",
He would foam, disregarding his broom.
But to ward off Jove's wrath,
He'd still skim off the froth
From the waves — hence despume, we presume.

The term euroky: quick to adapt.
The term stenoky: options are capped.
This tolerance scale
Is the new holy grail
When a species range needs to be mapped.

My quilt has a fine appliqué,
Sewn in place on a bright autumn day.
In colors like flame,
It spells out my name:
MEG BEAGLE!  I just want to bay!

If you're finding the world not fantastic,
And you're willing to do something drastic,
Be a brother and see
Just how good life can be
When all that you do is monastic.

Next week, while we're on our vacation,
Let's forget all about evigilation.
Let no clock us awaken
Let us laze at the lake, 'n
To time we'll have no obligation.

A cowboy collecting a zoo
Of marsupials knows what to do.
Maybe some will arrive
Via Rodeo Drive,
But the best deals are cheap: buck a 'roo.

I peered past her shoulder (I'm nosy).
"Embroidered," she said, "with a posy.
This soft, quilted form
Clads a teapot that's warm.
Stays that way half the day in a cozy."

Was that Jane on the seat of the train
Doubled over? The posture was plain.
(I decided thereafter:
She was scrunched up with laughter
Or displaying the strain of great pain.)

As I coughed, his expression turned weighty.
"Your lungs are a basket case, matey.
To best decongest them,
I suggest that you rest them.
Stop breathing and count up to eighty."

The landowner cut down a wood
And made boards. Then he saw that he could
Dispense all the lumber
To his neighbors—a number
Were poor. There he'd do the most good.

This journal's her autobiography.
Though it's written with perfect chirography—
Every word penned with grace—
Still its contents are base,
And to me it seems utter pornography.

Dad's sisters are nitro savants—
Of knowledge of bombs, they are fonts.
More amazing, these sisses
Help mohels do brises:
My dynamite, cutting brisance!

Scottish lads are well known to be clannish,
But their kilts seem a trifle unmannish.
Pardon me if I stare
Midst the deafening blare
Of the pipes. (Or perhaps I'll just vanish!)

A traffic-clogged highway's what bars
Forward movement of pickups like ours.
How we wish it were eely
So we could glide freely
Through thin, narrow gaps between cars.

"Don't worry," he snarled, "Have no fear,
For you won't see this guy disappear
Far away off the scene
Like he never had been.
I am staying for good.  Is that clear?"

The Bunyadi, a restaurant, debuted
With a menu of natural food.
There all cell phones are banned,
It's all candle-lit, and
They allow you to eat in the nude.

All the "mountains of trash" that I get
From the rubbish dump make my spouse fret.
But what others rejected
Is now disinfected
And flogged for hard cash on the 'net.

A bizarre-acting maid from Slovenia
Said, "I fear... that I have... neurasthenia!"
Watch her play with my keys.
It is obvious she's
Got disorganized type schizophrenia.

Leave the EZ? Now that sounds absurd.
Can it be one will exit that herd?
Have a name to describe
Who'd bolt eurozone's tribe?
Headlines claim that poor Greece is the word.

Hail to Aquitaine's Eleanor, queen
From the tender young age of fifteen.
Dealt four kings in her hand
(Elle, well played), her reign spanned
France and England, supreme and serene.

"La Bamba"'s a Mexican song;
With guitar you can sing right along.
But in Zambia Bemba
Are Bantus, remember?
To mix the two up would be wrong.

Through my thicker-than-thick pair of glasses
I can barely descry all that passes.
Would a corneal graft
Be corrective or daft?
Will it help me tell elbows from arses?

My arms are confined, so now you've
Got to give me more freedom to move.
Please step back and stand clear,
I need elbow room here.
Now watch this, I've got something to prove.

For temp'rature, we have thermometers;
For blood pressure, sphygmomanometers.
But to see aberration,
Experimentation
With light calls for sharp aberrometers.

When the train hit your car at the station,
I taught you the word deformation.
My comment was terse —
"It's a change for the worse."
(And in your case involved conflagration.)

If I quoted, "I came and I saw
And I conquered," you'd likely guffaw:
"Dummy!  Everyone knows
That asyndeton shows
A conjunction-free line is no flaw!"

A bodger, inept and unable,
Said: "To face up your ebony table,
I will first sand the top,
Then I'll speedily slop
On some paint, so it's blacker than sable."

The chef at the Vatican's smart,
And at breakfast he blazons his art.
The new Pontiff gets up
To hot joe in his cup
And eggs Benedict served à la carte.

We complain that school's hard back in Kitly.
As is suitable, Kit answers fitly,
But her comment's not pretty.
"Enough of self-pity!
In the Bronx it's much worse," she says. "WHITLY!"

If through lines of this limerick you wend,
Making turns when the path meets a bend,
You will find you cannot
Go beyond this one spot:
The conclusion, known best as the end.

When I hear what the doc says, I'm cynical:
It's too late for attention that's clinical.
Since he never confessed
To the "cure" that he messed,
Now I'm asking for help that's Rabbinical.

When the weather gets wetter this week,
I would use my umbrellar antique,
But my new one works better,
And gets me less wetter:
My bumbershoot's springing a leak.

Some mammals possess what is known
As the skeleton's cotyloid bone.
It's a part of the hip—
Very small, near the tip
Of the femur, and accident-prone.

If you'd like a delicious filet,
Our beef tenderloin's rated Grade A.
The Black Angus is fine,
And the Kobe's divine,
But the Charbray is special today.

Cyberfeminism studies and checks
Social constructs, like gender and sex,
Whilst desiring a new
True utopian view,
And its feminist muscles to flex.

From his tail—it's unable to cling.
He has teeth, thirty-two,
And a nose like a few
Humans do (but without any ring).

We abandoned Aunt Cassie  last year
(She was ailing and money was dear)
To an old person's storage
Facility. Porridge
She's eating thrice daily, I fear.

Every golfer whose drives veer askew
Should try practicing good follow-through:
One's new stance after striking
The ball to one's liking
Reflects a clean stroke in review.

New to British Columbia? Rain
Won't extinguish the anguish and strain.
Frequent downpours and drizzle
Cause incentive to fizzle.
Cherish sunny climes? Get on a plane.

As a wannabe starlet, she'd whine,
"Unemployment? That role should be mine!"
Why she lines in a queue,
Not an acting debut:
Missing cues and forgetting her line.

All in wool that's expensive I'm dressed.
I spent a week's pay on my vest.
You might think it's funny,
But what good is money?
That's mere cash, but it's cashmere that's best!

What's the metrical foot I like best?
Antidactyl! Well, haven't you guessed?
It is one and the same
(With a fancier name)
As our limerick friend, anapest.

A demure archegoniate fern
Was extremely delighted to learn
That her genitals, shaped
Like a flask, caused escaped
Little boy ferns to quickly return.

After showering, some will take care
To add volume and style to their hair
With a hairbrush and blow
Dryer.  Me?  Years ago
I did; now I'm not blowing hot air.

An eye-popping hunk is my guy
With a pipe and huge forearms — oh my!
When he dines with us Oyls,
Raw spinach he boils—
Then he gets a wild look in his eye.

Queneau produced verses plethoric,
But his poetry's aleatoric.
"Roll the dice for each line;
If they sound asinine,
I can claim all my art's metaphoric."

The river the Swiss call the Aar
Will meander, but never get far
From the canton of Bern,
Whose inhabitants learn
All its turns as they cross it by car.

A burning consumer did earn
Five guineas: high income, Laverne.
Most notions of price
Quite rarely suffice
To undermine vehement yearn.

Crucifixion was painful and gory,
As four told, and retold, in His story:
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John—
Passing on the baton—
The Evangelists spreading the glory.

But his wife, who's a nurse, simply said:
"Inflamed fundus — quite clear.
But don't worry, my dear.
It won't damage your cute empty head."

I chain smoke, I'm sorry to say,
So with each rasping breath
I draw closer to death,
In a matchlessly horrible way.

My dear lady, I fear I will snap
If you don't shut your yammering trap.
Kindly silence your maw,
Your kisser, your jaw,
Your geggie, your pie-hole, your yap!

Went to school with a nasty young lass
Who was known for her rudeness and sass.
Seems each time she would speak
She would curse a blue streak.
In our class we considered her crass.

Exiled Clement, in Pontus enslaved,
Prayed for water the multitude craved.
Lo! A lamb touched the ground
Where a wellspring was found.
Many souls by this wonder were saved.

An eventuality's something that may
Or may not, at the end of the day,
Come to pass. I'm surmisin'
It's on the horizon.
How likely, I can't really say.

To blackleg is really not cricket.
It's a habit? You really should kick it.
You will end in rehab,
For they say of a scab:
"It'll never get well if you pick it".

Our new grandchild will shortly be here,
Unaffected by praise or by jeer:
A blank canvas — untouched,
Thoughts and feelings unsmutched.
Watch her character slowly appear.

This submission's the start of the story.
It goes in, but before all the glory
Of approval and credit,
Other writers may edit.
Their work is adjudicatory.

It's batter from which you can bake
Loaves of bread on your plate, or a cake,
But in baseball, a batter's
At the plate, and it matters
Whether pitches go straight, or they break.

My mom is a doctor, and please!
She gets busy whenever I sneeze.
If she thinks it's infection,
She gives an injection
Of medicine—twenty ccs!

When you write all those bytes to your disk,
They get juxtaposed, squeezed, in a whisk.
You can't just pretend
Knowing where columns end.
You delimit the fields.  End of risk.

To connote means to hint or imply.
I can't see a good reason why
I should add a and t
To connote, so for me
This connotate nonsense won't fly.

Hannah, help me! The phrasing top spot
Sets me writhing and squirming a lot!
Dennis sinned? Oh, don't nod!
I feel all-over odd!
Can you name the disorder I've got?

True civilization began
With the hallmark of civilized Man:
Clean water's forthcoming
When you flush indoor plumbing.
Pardon moi, while I go to the can.

Are statements he'll use on occasions
For proving expressions

Of logic can brook no evasions.

Pelopia, screwed by her dad,
Thyestes, got pregnant and had
Aegisthus, a son,
Who she opted to shun…
Now it's here that the story gets bad.

Though to menace I'm hardly a stranger,
Don't scream if I'm not in its range, or
Alert me: "A fire!"
If the peril's not dire.
Could this threat be a clear, present danger?

We go bowling for physical fitness,
But you're hounded by 7–10-splitness.
Still, you made one last night,
Though your wife says, "Yeah, right!"
She doubter—you bowler—I witness.

The Houses of Parliament's tower?
Or the clock there, as some will avow? A
Mistake used for either,
Big Ben's really neither —
It's the bell that rings out on the hour.

I thought that you'd give me a kiss—
Not a pale imitation like this.
It just doesn't seem fair
That you're kissing the air—
Where you aim for my cheek, and just miss.

E. californiensis is making
Those killifish rise. Fish are breaking
Rules of piscine survival,
Flashing birds on arrival,
Signing, "Eat me! I'm yours for the taking!"

I ain't gonna tell you no lies:
A fly is an insect that flies.
The distinguishing thing's
It has one pair of wings,
Filmy-thin (lotsa bugs got big eyes).

Japan now commands admiration.
Its autos reflect innovation.
Economically powered,
The country has flowered,
Becoming a bloomin' carnation.

No husband on earth understands
Why his wife buys the priciest brands
Of both skin cream and lotion.
He creates a commotion.
Men just can't comprehend dishpan hands.

Cutleaf coneflower and golden glow
Are two names for a herb that I know
Grows up tall in the fields.
Yellow blossoms it yields;
Mother Nature creates a great show.

Said Satan: "Right here, sign in blood.
And in no time, you'll soon be a stud."
So I gave my autography,
But damn! My cacography
Made me, instead, Elmer Fudd.

I work nights in a dummy hotel.
It's a front for covert personnel
Who assassinate men
Every now and again.
Now you know, I must kill you as well.

Sir John Falstaff led Prince Hal astray,
Was a coward and cheat — but, I pray,
On this man don't be hard;
'Twas the pen of the Bard
That had writ him thus, all in fair play.

Speaking Friday, with shame undisguised,
"I'm a loser, disparaged, despised,
And disdained. I can't fight.

By the upper-class folks who parade
Through the streets of the town

That when Hitler requested an easement
Through Czechoslovak',
And he said "That's just talk,"
He'd be cursed as the worst, for appeasement.

Ancient Greeks were enamored of sports
And enjoyed the competitive sorts.
Each a victory ode,
Epinicia showed
Their respect—so my textbook reports.

Good for dancing; not deep; bright and merry.
Hear the eras unfold!
No, you don't feel too old
When you're bopping along to Chuck Berry.

Between thick knotted branches I lie:
Staring up from this tree, I could fly.
Twisted limbs are ensnarled
With each other and gnarled
In a lattice that splinters the sky.

Though true algae prefer to exclude
The cyanophytes, finding them crude,
They can float in your pool,
Looking blue-green and cool,
And, when sunbathing, synthesize food.

Defining barrico's a task
That is not what you'd call "a big ask".
You don't have to beg
Me to say it's a keg,
Or, perhaps, I should say a small cask.

No disputing — as dumb as they come..."
(Tough questions deflected —
An art I've perfected)

Well, you might find your name in Izvestia,
But not for excessive modestia.
Reputation? Quite sunk,
Since you're often found drunk:

Of music, has found

Episodically pleased our Giuseppe.
"An ephemeral high
From ephedrine is why,
At times schleppy, I'm now feeling peppy."

For high quality. "Cheap is OK!"
His new watch (what a laugh!)
Cost a buck and a half
And it gains 30 minutes each day.

King Richard the Third would lament:
"Cut my speech, and you misrepresent
What I said. What a bummer
To leave out the summer
That thaws our forlorn discontent!"

'Cause when push comes to shove,
Neither money nor love
Will deter me. I tell you no lie!

Ere I kill her I kiss her tonight,
Though her kiss is but treachery's bite.
If she lives she'll betray
Other men the same way.
Put the light out and put out the light.

On the limbs of bad children she'd shred.

By disseverment stings
With a wail that still rings
Up and down the maternity ward.

Or like relic from one of your martyrs.

With the old way — twelve digits,

Two letters together: AK?
It's the code for Alaska, I'd say,
Or a guy who'll kiss asses,
And then, as time passes,
Alter kocker becomes, and will stay.

The lost love of a love one adores.

Time to pray?  Okay, get thee unshod
And remove all the dust, grime and sod —
Use a footbath — it's meet

Townsfolk trust that their sheriff is right.

I deputised Flossie
As side-saddle deputy knight.

You can fly round in circles, of course,
But this spurious thing
Won't have helped you take wing

May require lofty catchers to seize
Girls and guys from thin air,
Then return them with flair
To their swings, with remarkable ease.

It with fate."  "Mate, that line is a beauty!"

And it hurt quite a lot;
So my walk's weird and wobbly of late.

Was "improved on" to pieces by one
And another, another,
And also his brother.

The sun shines in between
To the lower ravine,
And its rays cause the water to gleam.

Our family's good name you're besmirching.
Don't you know right from wrong from your churching?
Shut the branch lines? Dear me!
Are you out of your tree?
Richard Beeching, you need a good birching!

I'm beleaguered by armies of ants.
I retreat as their columns advance.
For I fear that I'll find that
These ants are the kind that
Perchance like to occupy pants.

Let me make, without any coercion,
This firm diagnostic assertion:
My boss is a guy
With intense CRI,
Meaning "cranial-rectal insertion."

With gold teeth in his womb.

To at least thirteen songs,
Both in English and Spanish translation.

To the role of the payer (drawee)
Of this check to my boss
To make up for his loss
When I set free his pet chimpanzee.

Our canoe hit an eddy's strong current.
It spun us around
With a force most profound,
But to paddlers like us?  No deterrent.

This fruit, used in Aztec cuisine,
Was named "testicle."  Sir, do you mean
Avocado implies
They admired its size,
Or  their bollocks were pear-shaped and green?

The cystometer readings are clear:
Bladder function's improved since last year.
Though your pressure's so-so
And capacity's low,
On the whole, Flo, you've little to fear.

Could it be when sweet amity ceases?
Should I say it's the transfer of leases?
Yes, alienate
Means these things — Oh, but wait!
It could also mean Pieces of Reese's.

Have beauty both outer and inner,
They should buy a good book
That will show how to cook,
And avoid making bookings for dinner.

Only one perfect shot,
And support she received far too late.

He's sucked out the whole damn amount!

He would act like a guy, truly male-ly.
Then one day, to my shock,
He came out, in a frock,
And was skipping rope merrily, gayly.

A percentage of profits. Tut, tut!
No complaints, it's our game;
And our ways are our fame—
Pay and play or you're shot in the gut!

With the airsickness bag on my lap,
I had given up hope of a nap.
As the plane kept on shaking,
My stomach was quaking…
I'll be making a trip to the Gap.

It's a challenge to battle. My rage
Can no longer be borne,
And my vengeance is sworn

The Jackass I watched on the telly
Couldn't spell: having reached for the gelly,
Instead of sweet treat,

Archimandrite, as we might have thunk,
Means the Peter or Paul
Who's in charge of them all
And unorthodox views must debunk.

My old knees make me moan and complain.

If I'm making a fist.

This dish can fit in, be a winner,
And be tasty, not pallid.
On a diet?  Fruit salad,
When sugarless,  helps you grow thinner.

Something new for the Cantonese fan.
It contains bamboo shoots
And can mend rubber boots.
I am calling it Shoe Goo gai pan.

I hate to seem rather particular,
But engaging in necking vehicular
In the Driver's Ed. car
Is exceedingly far
From practices deemed cocurricular.

This wicker of Palambang cane,
Light and flexible, takes on the strain
When the basket alights
From those sight-seeing flights,
Thus protecting the ones they contain.

Fast reactors? I ask: Will they last,
Or become just a thing of the past?
Will machines that are quicker
And newer and slicker
Displace the ones now known as fast?

Formed by flooding (alluvial)
And flowing (that's fluvial)
Plus erosion from wind, hail, and rain."

So delirious, deep in a state
That's too good to be true.

A cook in the Army named Pearl,
Gave the guys in the mess quite a twirl.
Although draining to give,

I hope you don't mind;  I'm proactive."
"Not at all," he replied.
"As for kids, I'll confide
That my sperm are all radioactive."

Act like right little Clottinghamshire,
Then say, "'Ere, c'mon cuz, quit yer Wht John!"

Go and seek an emporiatrician.

Disorders of travel.
Your fierce fungus, for him, is a mission.

As the dairy's developed a smell.
If that fabulous fay
Has for too long held sway,
The whole larder will turn to his spell.

That canny old stager
Shot down Ursa Major
And dragged it aboard Charles's Wain.

The blasphemousness, friend, of your curse?
It's inviting some lightning, or worse.
First you "God-damned" His name,
Then said He is to blame
For the hell in men's lives. How perverse!

I enjoy just as much dining out.
At Ye Olde Dining Inn,

At that drive-in both venues they tout.

Cap crucifix clutter creation?
Peg Protestant prop population?
Trick-trending truth tramples,
So seek several samples—
A valuable cross-validation.

To avoid being sober and glum,
There's a sign on the side,
"We are proud to provide
Duvel beer and the best demon rum."

The sacristy south of the bema
In an old Christian church? It would seem a
Diaconicon would
Be a place that you could
Store the treasures the priest might deem prima.

His intentions, it seems, matrimonial,
But he makes the demand
She do housework by hand
In the style of the goodwife colonial.

Canonero II: champion unique.
Won the Derby and then won the Preak-
Ness but not Belmont Stakes.
Came in fourth, them's the breaks.
A sore foot slowed this steed at his peak.

Yes, I often run late, my dear friend,
And I do have some emails to send
Plus some clients I'm seeing,
But still, all things being —
Um — equal, I'm bucking the trend.

In his eye I had tried cerebroscopy.

Just to paddle upstream's such a chore.'

No tornado — a petty event.
A diseasement, a little
Inconvenience, a tittle,
Unworthy of high discontent.

In my youth, I was known for intrepidness.
As I aged, people noticed some tepidness.
Well, I'm now 95,
And just glad I'm alive.
I'm not stressed by my growing decrepitness.

Being pious, I know that I shouldn't
Use god-awful words, and I wouldn't.
They're vicious and mean
Or just plainly obscene.
(I'm a Trappist, so really I couldn't.)

To fill holes that are caused by decay
In one's teeth. By this action,
The threat of extraction
Recedes (like one's gums, sad to say).

She's aloof, and her passion is dead.
So, unable to please her,
I went to our freezer
And warmed up the salmon instead.

Has no animal grace — none at all!"

My gazing globe gives a reflection
Of my yard, seen from every direction.
My daisies, my home
And my fierce garden gnome
All are shown in the chrome, to perfection.

My brother's a terrible tease;
He takes all my things with no "please."
He's a brat on attack!
"Now, give me that back!
I'm gonna tell mom on you...geez!"

I was stuffed full of beans while in Glasgow
When I felt a big flatulent mass grow.
I said, "Quick!" to my date,
"Leave at once. Do not wait!
You will not want to breathe should this gas go."

The folks up in Lambeau will scoff
At opponents.  The Giants (cough, cough)
Brought disgust to this crowd
With a trouncing.  Real loud
Were their boos; Packer fans were cheesed off.

He's been working that orchard, they say,
Forty years—never sick, by the way—
Always up to the task.
What's his secret, you ask?
The proverbial apple a day.

I am flying the bird-dog position,
Surveying the brush fire's condition.
All my facts must be right
For the bomber's first flight.
I'll report any further ignition.

Andante is walking-pace speed
In music. I hope you will heed
This tempo intention.
I guess I should mention
It's from the Italian. Agreed?

Overstaying his welcome, a pest
Of a parasite, getting me stressed,
Was sent packing.  "Goodbye
And good riddance," said I
As my bum of a son left the nest.

The Highlander had a bad vibe
When the Borneans started to gibe.
Then out came the pot
And in went the Scot.
'Twas a cruel anthropophagous tribe.

Mr. Benny would never turn fifty.
Regarding his age, he was shifty.
Forty loomed. He said, "Well...
That's too much! I rebel!"
In his mind, thirty-nine was more thrifty.

For your dinner this Christmas, I've heard
That the one that you want is the bird
Like a honking great duck.
Tell you more, you're in luck—
We have multiples. Geese is the word.

A new product with somber reviews,
Desaturation in 64 Hues,
Includes four crayon trays
Of blacks, whites and grays
Guaranteed to give children the blues.

"We will garnish your wages," they say,
"If you don't pay Doc Clayton today."
That sounds fair, so I won't
Gripe or moan. If I don't
Pay my doc, let his nurse dock my pay.

Shivered old hypochondriac Bill,
"I've been feeling so feverishly ill.
When I take to my bed,
I'll be waking up dead!"
"Just be cool," we encouraged him, "Chill."

That scavenging animals eat
And dispose of dead bodies is meet.
When carrion dine,
It's by nature's design,
So the circle of life is complete.

"This limo," said Barbie, "is Ken's."
As I focused, I felt that my lens
Was pulled tight by the tussle
Of my ciliary muscle;
I stared at his Mercedes-Benz.

Share my Civil War sexploits?  I shan't.
It's a personal thing; plus, I can't.
I went out with a lot.
The one memory I've got
Is I dated Ulysses S. Grant.

A punch that I brought to the dance
Was exclusively Cognac from France.
I admit I'm excuseless
For making it juiceless—
I thought it would foster romance.

The plot twists were never predictive,
So his stories were very convictive.
That is, we're convinced
By the details evinced.
His yarn-spinning's gotten addictive!

It's a humble apology Sid owes,
For he derogates orphans and widows.
Without shame he defames
And belittles old dames,
And disparages parentless kiddos.

That scatterbrain freely admits
She has trouble in using her wits.
And she'll shrug and respond,
"I can't help it—I'm blonde,"
When accused of becoming a ditz.

A blind man, a dolphin, a bat:
All use echolocation, and that
Is like guidance by ear:
Their locations appear
As an echo that tells where they're at.

Old readership figures were dwarfin'
The new ones. The title was morphin'
To a shorter one: Annie.
This fave of your granny
Had dropped two main words: Little Orphan.

My first thought was, "I'm going to jail!"
(A court summons had come in the mail.)
Civic duty for me —
On a jury, we'll see.
Now I have to respond without fail.

"I don't need a toupee," argued Davy,
"To make up for lost hair, blond and wavy.
I have trained, for this duty,
A golden agouti
To sit on my head.  Clever cavy!"

If you're thinking your house is a bore,
And owning it feels like a chore,
Transfer title to me
(I'm the alienee),
And then you'll be the alienor.

To cap this verse means each line must show,
With its head, how the last ended. So
Only end letters will
Lead the next line until,
Lastly, this verse is capped, head-to-toe.

With a body off Baywatch, he's hot —
From a distance.  Up close, not a lot!
Face off Crimewatch, his mug's
Like a plug-ugly thug's.
He's a bobfoc; most wanted, he's not.

Abdullah ruled Jordan, a nation
That would lead an immense federation
Of Arabs. This plan
Died before it began
With the king's premature termination.

Rein them in? There's no way; they just scoff.
(One percenters: the ones at the trough.)
It's not fair. I feel bad.
I'm disgruntled. I'm mad!
How come I'm not that rich? I'm pissed off!

You would think that with all of this rain
We'd be flooded again — what a pain!
But it all flows away
Under gravity's sway.
Thank the heavens for basinal drain.

Albariño's a wine grape from Spain;
Makes a crisp and dry drink that you'd drain
From your glass if you sipped some,
And if you had dripped some,
No problem 'cause white wines won't stain.

Mrs Jarvis, who never thinks small,
Staged a ballet in Cam Village Hall.
But Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake
Proved a major mistake
When a swan broke her hip in a fall.

The president's speaking, so hush.
His exaugural speech — it's to blush!
He is leaving his post
And we'll give him the most
Uninhibited outgoing flush.

One of Florida's beaches—hard-packed—
Allowed NASCAR-type sports to be backed.
Part of this state's persona:
The town of Daytona
Beach—magnet to tourists, fast-tracked.

I'd have never guessed that about you;
There was never so much as a clue,
But I now know, of course.
You're what's called  a dark horse—
It just hit me right out of the blue.

This medicine boasts the ability
To relieve both despair and hostility.
My mood is now stable,
A state that I label
Euthymia—peace and tranquility.

"Don't water that cactus!" I shouted.
"Its shoots will damp off — they've just sprouted!
With a sousing each day
They will surely decay."
"Oh, try soaking your head," Shirley pouted.

Acquired immunodeficiency
Is not met with required sufficiency;
For the people with AIDS
Don't desire parades,
Just a bunch of inspired efficiency.

Asked the bride, "Shall we darken our room?"
"It's your choice," sighed the eager young groom.
She gazed deep in his eyes
And then, to his surprise,
She said, "Let's paint it black as a tomb."

Being girl-less was taking its toll
On self-worth, so I took as a goal
To improve my technique.
And now helping this geek?
Hidden tools — they're my ace in the hole.

Binaural means "having two ears."
Hear crickets' soft chirp — or loud cheers.
(Not the crickets', of course;
Cheering makes them quite hoarse,
And a rash on the throat soon appears.)

An unpolished rube is a bumpkin.
An aft spar projection's a boomkin.
One hails us with "Y'all,"
One's found on a yawl:
Are homophones good for you, Pumpkin?

You know "BackRub" was Google's first name
For that search engine. Ain't that a shame?
Some might say quel dommage
That we lost a massage
For a silly tag. Who is to blame?

So I come to the word alkahestic,
And see it's (thank God!) anapestic.
The solvent it names
Is, by alchemists' claims,
Universal and therefore majestic.

Waking early, I heed my friend's warning
And break camp before daylight is dawning.
I get up off my back,
Pack the tent in my sack,
And set off as the night turns to morning.

See those girls pirouette and plié.
"Why, they must be from Europe!" you say.
But you're wrong: thank the Dean,
Mister George Balanchine;
He's the father of U.S. ballet.

You've turned my life 'round, have you not?
And you've made me much hotter than hot.
Now it takes all my strength
Keeping you at arm's length—
I think stalkers like you should be shot!

Dryland berries bear fruits that are sweet,
And for breakfast or lunch they're a treat.
In a muffin or pie,
Or whatever you try,
You will find them a pleasure to eat.

The broad Danube's a marvelous sight
As it flows west to east with great might.
There are capitals, four,
That its waters explore.
Can you name them? High marks if you're right.

Acinetobacter germs are scelestic
And thrive in surroundings domestic:
Don't fear penicillin,
Love hospital chillin',
And plague the immunodeprestic.

The force of repulsion/attraction
Of electric charge-charge interaction
Shows decreasing persistence
With the square of the distance
(The divisor in Coulomb's law's fraction).

I once knew a fellow named Yount
Who was robbed—I don't know the amount—
By his CPA's views
On whose money was whose;
His accountant he called to account.

We geometers try to divine
When our tangles of angles align,
So we'll stick to our plan, gents,
Avoiding those tangents,
Awaiting a positive sine.

If your omelet has feathers and legs,
There are pertinent questions it begs,
Which are: whose was the cock-up
That let a cock knock up
The hens, and who candles the eggs?

He has smoked both too long and too often.
His lungs have been poisoned; they soften.
Will just one more smoke
Bring the end of this bloke—
Be the ultimate nail in his coffin?

"All slips in the box!" Graves intoned.
"Far out!" Tessie cried. (Others groaned.)
"Though I moved to this town
When I heard folks get down,
Never dreamed they'd cast lots to get stoned!"

Many words of the Bard, it appears,
Seared a Bowdler's Victorian ears.
It was Harriet, though
(And not Thomas, her bro),
Who would edit those arses to rears.

Let's accelerate, step on gas, yo!
We dig speed and like fast more than slow.
Put the pedal to metal,
In rip-roaring fettle,
Va-va-voom, blasting off, go, go, GO!

Always dealing in tension and sleaze,
I just booked, seeking freshness and ease.
I've upgraded my life
With a Conch for my wife:
My Bahamian doll in the Keys.

A cross-sectional slice of a tree
(In square feet) to the logger is key.
It's the area known
As the basal and shown
To predict how much lumber there'll be.

My father was always suspicious
Of Mitch, who was over-ambitious.
"He'll be poor at his finish;
His wealth will diminish,"
Said Dad. "All his pelf? Ablatitious!"

Dice a celery stalk for beef stew—
It's for stuffing and casseroles, too.
And it's certain to please
When it's filled with cream cheese
Or with smooth peanut butter for you!

Fontanelles are soft tissues, I've read,
Which are part of a new baby's head.
They help lessen the strain
On the skull and the brain
To which birth might have otherwise led.

The Cardiidae Seaside Hotel
Serves a small but elite clientele.
There a bivalved young cockle
Who visits the dock'll
Get sun on his pasty white shell.

In the next life I'd like to kiss Zelda,
And I'd love to match shoes with Imelda;
But my favorite dream
(It's a heavenly theme):
Playing patience, with Job and Griselda.

"Do not stay me, I go to my Lord,
There on Holywell Hill, on the sward."
Alban parted the water
And hied to the slaughter
That added the palm to his sword.

In her honor, we'll now draw away
The curtain to place on display
A fine bust of the wife
Of our leader. Long life
To them both! (We'll take his head some day).

Chester's fire blanket's all he requires
To extinguish all small enough fires.
Spread on flame or on flare
It cuts off all the air.
Without air then, the burning expires.

The word caulome's not of my inventance;
You say "column"? You owe some repentance.
Of a plant's stem (in fact, Sis):
It's the structure, or axis.
Dare you now use this word in a sentence?

"This lesson is fraught with disaster,"
She muttered to all those who passed her.
"I copied six score;
I need thirty-eight more,
But there's none left in this ditto master!"

There are models still puking away
In the johns off the catwalk today.
Take a look: there's no doubting
These bone bags are flouting
The rules from the CFDA.

Stolen goods he'd accepted, then sold;
But the club members met and were polled,
And said, though he'd done wrong,
They'd admit to their throng
The ace golfer, who thus was enrolled.

You count in the first place to ten,
Then you do it all over again.
While this counting mode, denary,
Won't suit machinery,
Binary doesn't suit men.

"Now that straight hair's in fashion," said Fizz,
"Taming curls puts my head in a tizz.
It's a comfort that men
Show they've still got a yen
For the bits on my body that frizz."

Charm offensive: a kind of campaign
Where one flatters, cajoles, tries to gain
People's favor and trust.
Those in politics must
Use this craft so support doesn't wane.

Disharmony means there's no blending
Of outlooks. Take care when befriending
A guy full of dash;
If your temperaments clash,
Lots of time you'll be spending on mending.

You'll forgive me for lacking in grace,
But for Chrissakes, let's cut to the chase.
Time is money, you know—
Make your point and then go;
Skip the intro, let's get to third base.

It's a smoothly carved stick, on a string,
Whittled down round the edge like a wing.
When you swing it around
It will spin out a sound:
It's a bullroarer. Hear the thing sing.

Want a rather self-centered projection
Where, in each azimuthal direction,
Shortest paths appear straight?
Squash the globe like a plate;
That's your fine equidistant confection.

Simone Biles?  That gal loves to compete.
Four gold medals?  Now that's hard to beat!
Her achievements gymnastic,
Like the Biles, are fantastic —
Sweeping us, like herself, off our feet!

Razing towers, we never get bored.
Imprecision we just can't afford;
Our explosions will stink
If they're not quite in sync,
So I think we'll use detonating cord.

I had bragged of my foot's immense skill
At controlling the rudder, until
My huge sneeze jerked the cable;
Our boat was unable
To finish the race. Bitter pill!

Said the salesman: "Please don't think it brash
If I favor this plant, downy ash
(An American tree),
Though it's small, as you see.
Let me sell you one—plastic or cash?"

To my wife, as she kindly attended,
I said, "Dear, my damned ass pain's not ended."
So she called Dr. Page,
Who declared, "It's 'roid rage—
Anal-gesic is what's recommended."

"A cheap, showy trinket" is one
Definition for chachka. Much fun
Can be had with part two:
It's "a mistress." (Who knew?)
Give the first to the next and you're done.

Said my daughter, "My greatest desire
For my birthday would be a deep fryer."
"What, a thoughtful monastic?"
I said, "That seems drastic!"
"No—a frying pan's what I require!"

Devitalization in town
Is certain to cause you to frown.
Those large, empty stores
With graffiti-marked doors
Are so ugly, they make me feel down.

In Elsinore Castle, a Dane
With vengeful thoughts eating his brain,
Said, "Wait!  Though I feel
That my dad's ghost is real,
Perhaps I'm confused or insane?"

Adept cosmetologists know
How to give you a radiant glow.
With some shadow and liner,
You've never looked finer—
Your face went from woeful to "Whoa!"

There were holes in old Billy's net curtain
Caused by cigarette-ends, I am certain.
But if Billy won't learn
From one cigarette burn,
Soon his whole house will go for a Burton.

Take a silicate, then add some water;
Leave it millions of years (maybe shorter);
Keep it dripping or just
Let it slowly encrust:
You've got allophane. Sorta like mortar.

I've an agent I no longer see
Since he nabbed Angelina Jolie.
Now he'll frequently shirk
All the agenting work
He's supposed to be doing for me.

If I told you the Dead Sea was dying,
You would probably think I was lying,
But the world's lowest place
Is now having to face
Its demise. Thanks to man, watch it drying.

Protected by thorny brush fronting,
It's a blind that attackers find blunting.
It is known as a boma.
Where's it found? Oklahoma?
No, in Africa—use it when hunting.

Grandma shouted, "We never have fun,
You conventional killjoy!  We're done!
Your tedious life
Has just cost you a wife!
What a boring old fart!  Gotta run."

Does your product give promised effects,
As your customer rightly expects?
Are you wondering why
She's decided to buy
Your competitor's product, Brand X?

It's 20 to 3 in the bottom
Of the ninth. Angry patrons? We've got 'em.
Two belligerent  fans
Yelled, "You suck!" from the stands,
Which was true, but still rude, so we shot 'em.

Tommy Dorsey said, "Jimmy's my brother;
We've got  the same father and mother."
Said Jimmy of Tommy,
"Yes, same dad and mommy.''
Each sib led a band, like the other.

Young Vesper, dear Zypher's big bro,
In Oxford's library laid low,
His snoring so loud
Drew quite a crowd,
Till wake-up bells started to blow!

A new study has caused us to learn
A neutrino had more speed to burn.
It went faster than light.
Now that doesn't seem right.
Show me facts.  If they're wrong, I'll dis CERN.

It now is quite trendy to blog.
In today's intellectual bog,
There are many nice voices
And the most varied choices.
Yet there's seldom an outstanding frog.

I would ask her out but I'm shy.
I get tongue-tied whenever I try.
But I'm not going to mope,
For a man must have hope.
I expect I'll succeed by and by.

You're a pain in the ass, you ol' grouch,
So I need a soft bag, pouch, or couch.
Once I'm pushin' my tush in
An overstuffed cushion,
The padding might quiet the ouch.

Compassion inspired his pranks.
He provided a gun full of blanks.
When out hunting I shot
And I found I could not
Really hit something—then I gave thanks.

This statement should serve to refute
What the lady has claimed in her suit.
She's pregnant, okay,
But I'm sterile—no way
I'm the father: it's blanks that I shoot.

In reaction to hubris and knavery,
She fought to escape Roman slavery.
Boudica's tribe's loss
At the site of Kings Cross
Is remembered for fierceness and bravery.

May we offer these gaiters, M'lud —
These gamashes bespattered in blood?
They turned up in his rooms,
Where their presence presumes
They are his. His excuses are crud.

What is bitterweed? Something that mocks us.
Ambrosia? Perhaps Hymenoxys?
A Helenium plant
Or Conyza? Oh, can't
We just simply agree its taste shocks us?

"When we needed home runs, you hit bunts;
Shot the game warden twice during hunts."
"Told ya twice; told ya once:
Quit yer callin' me dunce!
If ya don't, I'll…" (The rest was just grunts.)

Dear ol' Dad's hard of hearing, it's true.
"For 'the worship of words,' in your view,
What word comes out on top?"
"Epeolatry, Pop."
"Happy holidays, son, to you, too!"

Baron Basil has started a hassle.
All us freemen he plans to envassal.
That would make me a serf,
Forced to work on his turf.
(Serf and turf both belong to his castle.)

The gunman said, "Give me your money."
This guy, it seems, thought he was funny.
I offered him twenty.
(I thought that was plenty.)
"Let's compromise. Give me your money!"

"Some eat oysters; not me," my friend said.
"And crustaceans, the same—'less they're red.
I'm not squeamish, you see,
But that works, least for me.
I avoid eating things that ain't dead."

Keep your freak hair and nose ring at home.
If you play where the buffalo roam,
Grab a Stetson and beer;
We drink long-necks 'round here,
Not that warm crap all covered in foam.

A lumberjack says to a cutter,
"We gotta dispose of this clutter.
Get that skinny guy Gil
Rolling logs down the hill.
He ain't heavy; he's only my brutter."

"I got chest pains! Could be a thrombosis,"
Cried the perp, "or severe acidosis!"
With the cuffs put on tight,
"That's ischemia, all right."
("Chrome-induced" was the cop's diagnosis.)

Beyond doubt, the new gift shop's first rate:
Varied stock, browsability great:
Indirect, skillful lighting;
Displays most inviting.
Your prize is there, lying in wait.

In this book Lewis sets out the scene:
There are worlds with a wood in between.
Nephew Digory brings
The Magician's charmed rings—
He wants Mum's health through Aslan's vaccine.

Old Miss Privet, who's pious and thin,
Wears a high-buttoned blouse to her chin.
Always modest in dress,
She regrets, nonetheless,
That her clothes tempted no man to sin.

Cyberstalker — I misunderstood.
I had thought it meant 'pruning dead wood
From a cyber-shrub border',
Not 'cyber marauder'
Concealed in a cyberspace hood!

An enchanting male dancer named Dantze
Had movements — well, just like a swan, say.
Some thought him a nancy,
His moves were so fancy,
Especially his artsy élancé.

Please grasp that worm firmly, not wormily,
Though it moves in a way kinda spermily.
Yes, get your grip tightened
And don't act so frightened —
Just quit acting squiggly-squirmily!

It's no bed of roses, my life.
I encounter much trouble and strife.
When I see your position
And wealth acquisition,
My jealousy cuts like a knife.

The Colonial family knew
That the shrubs and the pitch pine that grew
On their land offered light
When the dusk turned to night—
That a candlewood candle would do.

Is lettuce a part of Greek salad?
It depends, although both ways are valid.
But for certain, it betta
Include olives and feta
And tomatoes—nice red ones, not pallid.

In the forest, a ranger is put
On alert, finding ashes and soot
At a camp where the bone
Of a deer has been thrown.
It's a hoof, so the game is afoot!

Weigh the outcomes a choice could provide:
Pros and cons, list them down, side by side.
If the cons win the day
Then you ought to delay,
Think again. Don't let fate be your guide.

A chameleon turns green, brown, or blue.
A moth can have camouflage too.
To match what's surrounding
Is really astounding—
I wish I could do it. Don't you?

Due to mushrooms in hindsight quite reddish,
Ned's suddenly looking less Neddish.
Having made the same error,
I wait now in terror
Of also becoming as deadish.

I'm flat broke and for help I entreat.
In my kitchen there's nothing to eat.
I've no money to feed
My old dad; we're in need,
So I beg and I plead in the street.

Our robot is growing much older,
And his temperament grows ever colder.
Were he human, I'd judge
That he's holding a grudge,
So I'm fixing the chip on his shoulder.

When one's ill, one takes drugs for a cure,
And although this is useful, I'm sure,
I must frankly attest
That the drugs I like best
Have a strictly illegal allure.

Who moved on four legs, or just two,
And will never appear in a zoo?
He lived large in Cretaceous;
Was never predaceous.
The Edmontosaurus, that's who.

The facultative courses are best!
The compulsory ones are a pest.
These I have to attend
Right through to the end,
And I can't even skip the odd test.

No, I won't invest money; you chaps
Are too bullish. I'm thinking, perhaps,
Though the market is soaring,
We soon will be pouring
Out tears when we hear it collapse.

At the peak of Mount Burton it's breezy.
Some say gaining that point makes one queasy.
Climbers claim for this test
That the north face is best,
But I just took the ski lift. It's easy!

Said a medical student in Huron,
"In our text, I don't know what page you're on,
But I can't find in mine
How on earth to define
The cell body, a part of the neuron."

God-shaped holes unbelievers dismiss,
But a void in the heart of my sis
Is what drove her to prayer
And to God being there.
With His help, she escaped an abyss.

As a kicker, Nick Rose is the best.
Now he faces his ultimate test,
But a field goal, no doubt,
Starting 80 yards out
Is a challenge. It's good? I'm impressed!

Aviculture: this wonderful word
Uses avis (that's Latin for "bird")
And combines it with culture,
Which leads me to vulture—
A creature that flies, I've inferred!

Alocasias are grown by my aunts,
And with one of those tropical plants
Sporting leaves like a heart,
They'd reluctantly part
If you sent them a modest advance.

Next to washing and bathing, Ol' Jake
Was averse to the rattlin' snake.
When he squatted, he cussed,
As a snake bit the dust,
'Cause it fanged Ol' Jake's rear—its mistake.

"You'll get one of my horses from me,
With its saddle and bit, by decree."
"But this horse is too small;
I don't want it, at all."
"This pony conveys, disponee."

Growth industries soar — this one's going
From awesome to wow! There's no knowing
What heights we will reach
With our Own-Your-Own-Beach,
But our order-book's now overflowing.

Disquietful feelings I've found
When I hear roly-poly, or round…
If I'm cuddlesome, that
Sounds much better than "fat",
As in tales that my scales could expound.

It's dimidiate, cut right in half,
With a fruit knife, by one of my staff.
My knee, which was swellin',
He thought was a melon,
So now he's a felon. Some gaffe!

When it comes to bouquets, you're fastidious;
Every flower you choose is chlamydeous.
You refuse to extol a
Bloom lacking corolla
Or calyx; you claim they're all hideous.

His ethereal singing transcends
All the other men's vocal top ends;
Countertenors are rare
And there's none to compare
As his voice, like an alto's, unbends.

Whenever Jack wants to speak clearly,
And he has a dark secret held dearly,
To the challenge he'll rise
And speak nothing but lies.
Who can tell that he speaks insincerely?

Now, Caltha's a genus of ten
Common species you'll find in a fen
Or a marsh or a ditch,
One example of which
Is the meadow bright here in this glen.

So I say, "The wife's gone until five.
Come with me: come on up; come alive!"
Then she turns, "Wait a sec —
Once again, you're a wreck.
Look, you're blitzed, so you're not fit to drive."

Cries Omphale, "Go clean off the table!
I know good and well that you're able!"
One look at the dishes
And Hercules wishes
He'd passed on Augeas's stable.

Using sheep cheese in intercoms?  Gee,
No investors are there to agree
My all-natural phones
Could be worthy of loans,
So I'm sunk in a feta-com plea.

My drum teacher set me this riddle:
"With a grace-note at start and at middle,
Which two rudiments meet
For a d'RAT-a-tat-tat beat?"
"Flamadiddle — a flam-paradiddle."

I ask what wood the frame of my harp is.
Martha says: "It's from Dipterocarpus."
She's a botany student
Whose answers are prudent.
I'm surprised the young coed so sharp is.

We fish from the top of this rock. Why?
More fish swim near here than the dock.  Why,
By this fast-flowing stream
Sockeye fishing's a dream—
But do not call these great waters aquae!

There was a young swimmer called Clive
Who wanted to practise his dive,
But he farted (the fool)
And zoomed out of the pool
Like a rocket. He didn't survive.

An assimilator,  that's what I am:
Loads of data's absorbed as I cram.
Into textbooks I plunge
With a brain like a sponge —
Which I'll squeeze in my final exam.

At the coming-out party for Ray,
He made his announcement: "I'm gay!
No more closet for me;
From now on, I am free!"
 Now the hard part: he's finding his way.

Out of Elmer's! Now what shall I do?
I hear horse parts compose this white goo —
And parts cattle and sheep!
Now I'm stuck losing sleep
As I weep about animal glue.

It's unwritten, this law in the land out
Wherever this train is a standout.
Accommodation?  You bet!
You ain't seen nuthin' yet!
Stop this train just by sticking your hand out.

His knowledge of colors was loose.
The one that he thought was chartreuse
(That's a bright yellow-green)
Was the shade of my spleen —
What the color definers call puce.

Counting Jennifer's flaws?  There are many.
But her scruples?  She hasn't got any.
Her job is provoking
Young folks into smoking.
Her friends call her Carcino-Jenny.

The element cerium's found,
Like its lanthanide pals, in the ground.
It's a metal that's rare
In the earth (here and there),
But can also be said to abound.

Mountain climbing without a pup tent
In warm weather's a big non-event.
But in ice and in snow,
Please don't ask me to go:
No assent for a bivouac ascent.

To dietary law I stay true.
Certain foods, certain drinks are taboo,
So from these I abstain.
Yet that doesn't explain
Why my weight is 472.

A tough bird joined his bud in a meeting
For the purpose of unison tweeting,
But their tones were just off;
Hence the bird, with a scoff,
Gave his not-quite-tuned buddy a beating.

Archaeologists dug by the Nile;
Found a mummy that caused them to smile.
With a chocolate shroud
In a hazelnut cloud,
Pharaoh Rocher was buried in style!

"Dave, I'll meet you at Grand Central Station."
"No, you won't. Though you know the location,
Your knowledge is germinal—
It's Grand Central Terminal.
You're using the old designation."

We old hippies (our parents' despair)
Like to think that our era was rare.
Our trousers' flared bagginess
Was matched by the shagginess
Of beards and moustaches and hair.

My cousin's a bolshie, a commie.
It makes her a terrible mommy.
She cooks for her brood
Using only red food,
And they're living on borscht and salami.

Good bookbinding's truly an art.
But a human-skin binding's apart
From the rest. Makes me squirm. Ick —
Such anthropodermic
Bibliopegy's well off the chart.

In my chemistry class, a large faction
Of us gals find that hunk a distraction.
As he strolls to his seat,
He sure generates heat—
It's a most exothermal reaction!

Citrus limon has bright yellow fruit
With a juice you might want to dilute.
Take a sip and you'll scowl;
Take a gulp and you'll howl;
Take a bite? It will render you mute.

Each morning will start with "Bonjour!"
When you journey through France on a tour.
A suggestion from us:
If you travel by bus,
Try a charabanc—comfort for sure.

Nerdy Jack needs to practice subtractions,
But reacts to attractive distractions;
And he'll gain distractibility
With the pain and futility
Of subtracting intractable fractions.

It's a trial of our love and emotion
That attests to our faithful devotion:
I've been waiting all year
In my flat, over here,
While my bonnie lies over the ocean.

Nine strikes on one pitch? A cartoon!
But in Major League Baseball there soon
Was a saver — the top —
And his change seemed to stop,
His Bugs Bunny change-up — a boon.

Transferases we prefix amino
(The transaminase enzymes that we know)
Promote amination.
Will this explanation
Make me a Nobel nominee? No.

A sport of the young urban male:
Placing junk on a railway line.  Jail
Is too good for such louts
When the cops have no doubts
It's so trains will veer off and derail.

There once was a woman named Dante
Whose skirts were incredibly scante.
She would wear her bandeau
Unbelievably leau
To eclipse any glimpse of her pante.

When July the 14th comes to pass,
In France I shall do something crass.
I'll fulfill an old wish
In a shop that sells fish:
On Bastille Day I'll steal me a bass.

Collaborators each take a part
(Like songwriters Rogers & Hart,
Or Lerner & Loewe)
In creating a show:
They both must be clever and smart.

We are dining tonight Chez Marcel
(Fresh flowers, white linen: it's swell).
All of which paves the way,
Through the Champs-Elysées,
To a passionate nocturne chez elle.

Showing symptoms of fungal infection,
The trees will need closer inspection:
With weakened trunks tilting
And leaves sadly wilting,
Disease doesn't take much detection.

It's a typical boy-meets-girl movie
From the '60s: Dad's all disapprovey,
"You're too young!" They elope.
They make love and smoke dope.
Grampa loves his new granddaughter Groovy.

At the Whistle Stop Cafe, I'm sure
Many customers often prefer
Green tomatoes there fried,
Not quite ripe. (An aside:
That's a book I suggest you procure.)

It's not in the Alps, like Montblanc's,
Nor the tropics, where people hunt conchs.
It's a part of our city
That can get pretty gritty.
Ogden Nash wrote "No thonx" to the Bronx.

Our products have endless variety.
We spend with no trace of sobriety.
The poor are all nervous,
With scant social service.
That's us: an affluent society.

Lord Netherbourne liked to emblaze
His regalia in one of two ways,
Either sequins and gems,
From the necklines to hems,
Or his motto (in mink) "Breeding Pays".

Spock was dead. Things were looking quite grim.
"What's the best-case scenario, Jim?"
  "Well, at best," he replied,
  "We'll escape, though Spock's died,
And at worst, we'll all end up like him."

Big Business can make us all pay
Through a hell of a big "dba."
By whatever the name,
They're running the game,
Doing business as "U.S. of A."

Acclaim, accolades and applause
Can make virtues of personal flaws.
Renown can be cloying,
And even annoying,
'Til obscurity opens its jaws.

A boxer knocked out in round three
Thought he'd write to Muhammad Ali
For his secret—who wrote,
"What you do is, you float
Like a butterfly, sting like bee."

As you sail between Denmark and Sweden
Through the Kattegat strait, please be heedin'
All the treacherous rocks!
Wish your boat had some shocks
To absorb every unfriendly greetin'.

A state of contentment is great—
You're at ease, you're fulfilled, free of hate.
But when there's dissension,
It leads to contention
And enmity slow to abate.

Disinherited!—Dad was strong-willed.
So he left me with zip. I'm not thrilled.
Know why I'm wearing black?
'Cause I can't pay him back.
See, I'd like to (but can't) get him killed.

"Will he chase other dogs in the park?
Will a knock at the door make him bark?
Will he sit? Will he stay?
Will he always obey?
Do you mind that I ask?" questioned Mark.

A radish they like in Japan
Is the daikon, and now I'm a fan.
Be it cooked, be it raw,
It's a root that I chaw
With great gusto whenever I can.

My inquisitive golden retriever
Killed a beaver and now has a fever.
So I'm giving the bitch
Acetanilid, which
Is a fevered retriever reliever.

For thickening liquids, most prize
Fine flours of oats, wheats, and ryes.
If your gut vetoes gluten,
Just use arrowroot in
Your sauces, your puddings, your pies.

Deletory things will delete,
Cover over, block out, make discreet,
So you'll never bemoan
What you shouldn't have shown.
Curtained CommentBut your copy will never look neat.

A distriction's a sudden display
Of a flash or a glitter and may,
Like a bright signal flare,
Light the night sky up where
Those below can quite clearly survey.

As a babe, Dad in bunting was swaddled.
As a toddler Dad had, of course, toddled.
At the time that Dad died,
The strange word folks applied
To his wobbly walking was doddled.

The crash landing on top of my roof
Was—in technical language—a "goof",
So the pilot explained,
In a voice somewhat strained.
He received a plain English reproof!

A person who books is a booker;
That girl over there is a looker,
But it's I who have looked
At her charms, and been hooked:
Does it follow she must be a hooker?

That posse, oh how they harangue us.
The sheriff is fixin' to hang us!
No, we won't live to chow
On a hornless black cow
Bred in Scotland and known as Black Angus.

The bagpipeless piper was sore.
He yelled loudly, "Now, this I deplore!
Why would pilferers filch
An old bagpipe worth zilch?
Has my bagpiping been such a bore?"

You're inadequate.  Here's what I mean:
Inferior, not worth a bean.
In a word, you are dicky,
Or (yes, this sounds icky)
In four words, you're dick in the green.

"I'm free!" "Stupid boy." "Shut that door!"
"Nice to see you..." "Don't mention the war!"
"And it's goodnight from him."
"My name's ... no ... no ... no ... Jim."
"You dirty old man!" "Say no more!"

I know I've put on lots of weight.
Wouldn't mind, but there's one thing I hate:
It's a double chin—ouch,
It looks just like a pouch!
I'll start slimming, it's never too late.

Paracelsus, alchemical master,
Had a cure for near any disaster:
A mercurial liquor
Called azoth that's quicker
And stronger than oil of castor!

Said the chem prof, "When working with lye,
Wear your gloves, in case things go awry."
"Why didn't you tell me
Before it befell me!"
Tom caustically said in reply.

The doctrine of signatures: odd
That the answers were written by God
In the shapes within herbs,
Like some mystical blurbs;
Read aright, they said, 'Good for the bod.'

I've got too many things on my plate —
Overburdened's my lot, no debate.
I'm discouraged and blue
And disheartened, that's true;
Disanimation's the word for my state.

Time has passed, and I feel we're affectionless.
Our affair has gone stale and directionless.
Our romance hit the floor;
We're not joined, any more,
At the hip. Gonna skip.  We're connectionless.

What's a fumigant? Poisonous smoke,
Gas or vapor, intended to choke
Pesky pests in your house,
Every bug, flea or mouse.
So do not snort it up, or you'll croak.

Every punch that he's landing is stinging!
'Round his chest, tired arms I am flinging.
Now the ref wants a break.
I let go. Big mistake!
"…Eight! …Nine! …Ten!" How I wish I'd kept clinging.

Play this ode on the flute and euphonium,
As I sing to the word carpogonium.
Consider, I beg,
In some seaweed, each egg
Is a gonad. There's no pandemonium.

There once was a merchant of Flint
Who flourished; he made quite a mint.
But his luck turned around
When his ship ran aground.
Now he's stony-broke, destitute, skint.

Let's play Hickory, Dickory, DACA:
Add six months to an ominous clock—a
Blow to the Dreamers
From government schemers.
Will some soon be recruited by Raqqa?

In a duel, you plan to delope?
That's the game plan of some kind of dope!
You shoot first, hit the sky,
And then wait for the guy
Who's your foe to do likewise, you hope!

Is your licence to drive still OK?
Now the tax on your car you must pay.
Check insurance as well!
We're the folks you must tell:
Down in Swansea: the DVLA.

Though the posts at the end of the quay there
Appear to be just in the way there,
Those bollards secure
All the ropes, and insure
That the boats in the harbor will stay there.

The crowd jostled, then shouted, "Oh, no!
This new statue's grotesque. A poor show!"
All the townsfolk would share
Their disdain and despair;
Yes, this eyesore would just have to go!

I caught Vi with that big hunky Sly,
Pulled my piece, then Vi, starting to cry,
Sobbed, "Sly's love is platonic."
Though her cheating was chronic,
I, the fall guy, just swallowed Vi's lie.

The word belted means three different things:
Belted bathrobes are those tied by strings;
If it's belted, your eye
Looks like blueberry pie;
Belted songs are so loud my ear rings!

Foreign autocrats, here's where you stand;
You want money from us — well that's grand.
We'd approve foreign aid,
But it might be delayed
Because propping up despots is banned.

That hack's an auteur? Not Mackenzie!
His close-ups are all fish-eye-lensy;
All his angles are Dutch —
Oh, I hate it so much
That it's driving me into a frenzy!

Once a baby-maker, maker of dollies,
Jack went broke; it was one of his follies.
But that skill turned out handy:
He married Chef Brandi —
They beget baby candy (doll lollies).

Banished and exiled — disgraced —
With a life far from home he is faced.
No one knows what he did
For he's keeping it hid,
Though they're certain it's something debased.

When I visit museums of art,
Certain paintings can capture my heart.
From afar they engross,
But when seen from up close,
It's their brushwork that sets them apart.

Said his mother to clever young Fred:
"On Monday, I heard that you said
That your teacher was dying—
She's alive! You were lying!
You're in trouble, young man. Go to bed!"

A conventicler's where the first Quakers
Held meetings until there were takers
For schemes to abandon
The Old World for land in
A New World of friendlier acres.

Cousin Mame was aflame with the claim
That emoting on stage would bring fame—
That wherever she'd go
Folks would know her, but no,
People passed her right by just the same.

The back judge, most certainly paid,
Considered the game un-delayed.
On replay, a second
Was clearly not reckoned.
My backers, by his, were outplayed.

Said his wife, "Button up! You are old!"
He replied, "I won't do what I'm told!
Don't treat me like a kid!"
He went out. What he did
Was to shiver all day in the cold.

I hope that my boyfriend won't mind
If I say that we two are affined,
'Cause it means closely bound
And he'll often expound
That he's just not the marrying kind.

Surrounding our prez is a group
Of advisors who give him the scoop
On important affairs,
Yet he acts unawares.
Do the brain trusters know he's a stupe?

"What's the sound of a buss?"  "Maybe this:
The roar of the engine, the hiss
Of the air brakes, the beep
Of a horn—like a jeep."
"Wrong! The lips-to-lips smack of a kiss!"

If I bevel this image, you'll see
That the edges appear in 3-D.
To be graphically sleek,
I can use this technique
When designing on Mac or PC.

We're shut down and sealed up, in the main;
That we want ventilation is plain.
If we're open to air,
We get soaked; it's not fair.
Awning windows work great in the rain.

Armadillo eggs—pard, you look pasty!
Stuffed with cheese, bacon-wrapped—don't be hasty.
Now keep your dang hose up,
And don't turn your nose up.
Just stuffed jalapeños, real tasty.

"Brigadier, keep the chargers reined tight!
What number are ready to fight?"
"There are five ninety-nine
With their lives on the line."
"This brigade is a little bit light."

So you promised to post that one letter,
Then forgot, so, OK — 'Could do better!'
Donning sackcloth and ashes?
Wielding canes for self-bashes?
Disproportionate punishment-setter!

And the Watch comes with news for the cause:
Here's Borachio, caught! He gives pause
To harsh Claudio's fury,
Confessing, "Oh, jury,
She's blameless — they're mine, Hero's flaws."

An enzyme that helps you digest:
Acid protease folds for its quest—
To find protein, its goal,
And to break down the whole,
So that you can absorb your meat best.

I can see that you care about meter,
And my rhymes could be just a bit neater,
But it looks like your plan
Is to build a sedan
From my sporty old rag-top two-seater.

A beanbag is barely a chair.
A dozer is barely aware.
The sun almost down,
A gossamer gown,
And a shadow are all barely there.

Our new program will iterate through
All the records we're keeping on you.
Its control loop will find
Any lapses of mind
That condemn you in Big Brother's view.

There are diatoms floating around
In the seas, and their numbers astound.
With plankton-like features,
These minuscule creatures
(From  Coscinodiscus) abound.

The most perfect example, by far,
Caused a turning of heads at the bar.
Someone called, "You look fit to me;
You're the epitome
Of all that I want. You're the star!"

The red-footed booby's a bird,
With a name that sounds strange and absurd.
This guy that I know
Whose social skills blow
Is also a booby—a nerd.

Of Florentine art, I will bellow:
It was swell,  just because this young fellow,
After working in Rome,
Brought the ancient style home.
I refer to the great Donatello.

"Why don't women stay home," said this clerk,
"Raising kids while the men go to work?
Equal pay with a man
Is a joke! We should ban—"
At this point I cut in, "You're a jerk!"

The word farry a farmer might dig;
It means "farrow": a litter of pig.
I so told my friend June,
Who was eating a prune;
She said, "Frankly, I don't give a fig."

There is one thing that all people share,
Humble beggar to great millionaire.
When it comes down to breath
For avoidance of death,
There quite simply ain't no topping air.

No iambic pentameter here
For the elegy (sadly, I fear),
As this poet's lament
Employs anapaests meant
To pay homage to Limerick Lear.

Here's a story Australian: one grieves
When one reads of the tale Wiki weaves.
Cinnamomum camphora —
Koalas deplore a
Pervasive intruder with leaves.

I had finished my moo goo gai pan
When the sweating and headaches began.
Once again, MSG's
Got me loathing Chinese;
Do they use it in food from Japan?

Mystic alchemy turns lead to gold,
But the process, alas, is mistold.
Like the soul, gold's below —
Buried deep is the glow
Which merges white hot with the cold.

Put a stereo in your Corvette,
Either 8-track or audiocassette,
So that every day, you
Can rock out to The Who:
You better, you better, you bet!

When that bastard molested my son,
I came after his ass with a gun.
Now the eyes of that jerk
And his kneecaps that work
Are the same puny number: just one.

Epistemophilia? Yes!
I love knowledge, it's true, to excess.
To cold facts I'm hot-wired.
They're more greatly desired
Than a beautiful woman's caress.

In a written report by the fuzz,
They said I was froward because
I'm contrary a lot.
(That's my style.) It was not
Just the typo I'd thought that it was.

Here in Britain you'll find all agree
It's a football club's name that you see
When the place written down
 Is a city or town
And is followed by letters: FC.

Greaseproof paper is lining this tin,
So my cake-mix that's sitting within
Its four walls will not stick.
It's a fine baker's trick,
And no washing up after's win-win!

When I coach my son's Little League team,
I don't browbeat or badger or scream.
We're just there to have fun
And when practice is done,
I'm the one who will run for ice cream.

Futurology studies the trends
And the patterns in life. It contends
That what lasts, or what changes,
Results from the ranges
Of factors the present portends.

What good's sitting alone in your room?
Just watch Cabaret and the gloom
Will, like magic, be banished—
Each trace will have vanished—
While Liza sings, Nazi threats loom.

"I will gamble you out of your soul,"
Crooned the Dark One, "your spirit's my goal."
"This seems terribly fraught;
Shall I risk it?" I thought.
"Can I chance my way out of this hole?"

The infant was blue-lipped and cold,
Barely more than a month or so old.
Lips dark and pale blue,
Nothing more we could do.
Now she's warm, in God's heavenly fold.

He is albicant, that is to say,
He gets whiter and whiter each day.
To my dear Mr. Jackson
I say: to be Black, son,
Is beautiful (no shades of grey)!

Dollar bonds are a way to raise debt
That investors will think a safe bet.
Foreign currency loans
May feel wrong in your bones,
But they're not too much trouble, as yet.

I love legumes, the family of peas
And their kin, whether small plants or trees.
Many beans I adore, so
Think "fab" only more so:
Fabaceous—remembered with ease.

By catechization, religion
Is taught, leaving only a smidgen
Of freedom to think
For yourself. They say blink,
And you blink—a Pavlovian pigeon.

Glissando: a musical name
For a "slide" between notes not the same.
From low notes to high
(The reverse would apply);
Such music may get some acclaim.

There's a comma whose use is debated
And many think quite overrated.
An example's here seen:
"An ex-girlfriend's just been
Well wedded, soon bedded, and mated."

You may ask, "Where's this comma here used?
At the moment I'm feeling confused."
It's not to be dreaded,
The one after bedded,
Called Oxford, and sometimes abused.

The life of a teen is complex.
For a male it involves, one expects,
Things like fashion, and school,
And the need to be cool,
Yet the accent is always on sex.

Said a child, Uncle Sam's misbegotten,
"I'm an apple that's thoroughly rotten.
They don't want me no more
'Cause I'm bad to the corps.
It is best that my hitch is forgotten."

Brett said: "Let's see the Mets' exhibition game."
"Wow! A baseball-played-naked-tradition game?"
"No! The match, though demanding,
Can't change the team's standing.
It's a fully-clothed-only-admission game."

While boastfully brimming with pride,
The braggart kept swelling inside.
But with no one to tell,
He continued to swell
'Til he suddenly burst—and he died.

He's well-mannered in word and in deed.
He helps out when some soul is in need.
He's courteous and fair,
Straightforward and square.
He's a gentleman: such a rare breed!

While one kitten plays  bat, pull and shove it all,
The other, with rubs, says, "I love it all."
Their elders ignore
Foolish fluff on the floor
From a shelf — high, aloof and above it all.

Our love for algology flaming,
To classify kelp we were aiming.
From Maine to Eugene,
Oh, the seaweed we've seen!
And each alga we'd see we'd be naming.

Oh, boy! I can't wait! Boy, oh, boy!
Like a kid with a shiny new toy,
I feel I could skip
Every step of my trip
To Disneyland. Wow! What a joy!

From disaster is born a success!
The meringue fell apart, I confess;
And the strawberries and cream
Have continued this theme.
But it tastes like a dream — Eton mess!

"My great-aunt was a world-renowned beaver,"
Bragged Bette, and I tend to believe her.
"She made felt, and so that's
Her connection to hats,
A chapeau-making over-achiever."

The content the movie presented
Left you sad and depressed, not contented.
It was frankly so bad
That you're thankful and glad
That you won't have to keep it—it's rented.

An albatross killing occurred,
And the mariner's penance? Absurd!
But his great-great-great-great-
great-great-grandaughter's fate?
Her name's Björk and she too wore a bird.

Having written a passionate tome
To his far distant girlfriend, Jerome,
When he'd finished the note,
On the envelope wrote
The word BURMA and posted it home.

I asked, "Doc, is it true you're a grafter?"
He looked startled, then burst into laughter.
"I'm no criminal loser —
Just a dermatome user.
Thin skin for your graft's what I'm after!"

What a beauty she was — licked my chops!
On that day, I sure pulled out the stops —
I got carried away.
When she spritzed pepper spray,
I got carried away by the cops.

"I've a pillar here, where shall I stick it?"
"Well, assuming the base ain't too thick, it
Should rest in this chime.
Lower away, take your time.
There you go—perfect fit. Just the ticket."

As botanical garden curator,
I will put off retirement till later,
And forfeit vacations
To maintain notations—
Plant data work couldn't be greater.

These puppies are all different breeds,
Many colors and sizes and speeds,
But they're all conspecific
(That term's scientific,
Implying cross-breeding succeeds).

Echolalia? You seem in a daze,
Looking crazed, as your eyes have a glaze.
You can't make yourself clear,
But whatever you hear,
You repeat—every word, every phrase.

I recall when Kirk Gibson played ball
For Detroit and LA.  He stood tall
In both power and speed.
Playing hurt, this tough breed
Hit a Series pitch over the wall.

I've a coccyx, by natural design.
(Tailless apes also have one, like mine!)
But if chased by a gibbon,
I'd say (without fibbin'),
"Old friend, it's the end of the spine."

There once was a girl named Alceste
Whose temper was testy at best,
But her artwork, you see,
Was serene as could be.
To this I can truly attest.

A bottleneck narrows things down
On the highways and streets in a town;
And then, may I ask,
Regarding a flask:
Is a bottleneck's stopper its crown?

In the mountains of France, we again
Take a break from the hiking, and then,
In our quiet chalet,
I get snifters and say,
"Let me pour you some cognac—Cévennes."

When a guy who wrote Truths for the Wise
Was awarded a non-fiction prize,
A voice from the crowd
Cried: "Desist!" very loud.
"Stop the service! His book is all lies!"

After eating, you always feel bum,
And the pains in your abdomen come
From a shortage of flow
Of the blood down below—
You've abdominal angina, chum!

Our poetry's worth never fades;
Our readers will put on parades!
How they'll cheer!  How they'll roar!
They'll send presents galore,
And pour accolades down in cascades!

Though I've tried, I just can't fall asleep!
I'll try counting some fluffy white sheep.
1, 2, 3 (yawn) and 4,
Five and six … seven … (snore!)
("Is she sleeping?" "Oh yes, not a peep.")

From my wife came the ultimate word:
"Build a badminton court!"  I was spurred
To create what would please her,
But failed to appease her.
Why else would she flip me the bird?

It means "bushy." But prone to verbosity,
I'll say that this plant has dumosity.
The word dumous, in fact,
Means, moreover, "compact."
These old words are a rare curiosity.

The King of the Merpeople's daughter
Finds concealment near bodies of water.
She can mystically hide
'Midst the mist and the tide,
So we've missed her whenever we've sought her.

Alliterate: set sounds at the start
That resound and repeat to impart
A fine feeling of flow
(Or some silliness show)—
It's intriguing, it is.  Is it art?

As His Playboy Band backed him, John Fred
Sang of Judy, disguised.  It was head
Of the pack for two weeks,
But with no further peaks,
Only valleys, the band went to bed.

Said the peasant, 'Oi, Thomas, could you
Lend a hand with this water I drew?'
As I shouldered one end
Of his stick, he said, 'Friend,
A stout colstaff swings burdens twixt two.'

The explorer was vexed that he'd picked a
Tough fight with a boa constrictor.
'Twas a bad choice to make —
Bets were all on the snake.
And guess what? The constrictor's the victor!

I've eight garners aburst with sweet corn:
As agreed, so I'll not be forsworn.
Though your name's often slurred,
You've been good as your word.
Claim your prize, Nick: to you, my firstborn.

Many companies prize EAPs.
They please bosses; they please employees,
Since for workers in need,
Their referrals, indeed,
Help with any distress or disease.

Grandma Gail tells a tale that is gory,
With villains and heroes and glory,
But she causes confusion;
It lacks a conclusion.
She's forgotten the end of the story.

We were strolling last evening through town,
When my wife said, "Let's boogie on down
To the club for some clubbing."
"No, the pub for some pubbing!
'Cause dancing," I said, "makes me frown."

Debt-to-equity ratio compares
How much funding's from bonds versus shares.
Doing well when it's high
Makes your equity fly;
Doing badly will kick it downstairs.

There's an outdoor sport, cross-country riding,
Which gives horsemen a feel for deciding
How to ride the right way
Over obstacles, say,
When in search of a fox who's in hiding.

I have finished the first fifty-four
And my stomach's so full that it's sore,
But your cakes are so good
That it's well understood:
I am eating another (one more).

Learning cerebral structures? Infernal!
This chapter describes the cisternal
Sacs in everyone's brain.
Though to learn them's a pain,
I am writing their names in my journal.

Would you like a nice slice of French pie?
Tell me yes and a bird's gonna die.
Though it sounds like dessert,
I am here to assert
It's a woodpecker, really. (No lie!)

Sandalwood, jasmine, and rose
Are musky delights for the nose.
But I'll cough, spew, and sputter,
And puke in the gutter,
Confronted with attar of toes.

Oh dear—I've upset Desiree.
Made some scones, proposed stealing away
For a snack on the straw
In the loft. Slapped me raw!
Man, what's wrong with a roll in the hay?

For J equals zero to ten,
If (int) A less than X sub J, then
Pop address to go back
From the top of the stack,
Else recurse this damned program again.

When the shock wave is thundering past
Even faster than sound, then at last
It will drive the reaction
Where the fire's lost traction;
You've achieved detonation! A blast!

Oy, contrariwise — logical curse!
Throws the sense in reverse, and what's worse,
Makes the reader go back
'Cause the flow's out of whack —
On the other hand, so does this verse.

An assemblage of folks is a group,
Though at times you might call it a troupe
Who you hope will stay well —
Their hoarse voices will tell
Which performers develop the croup.

I was frozen because I was scared —
For that galvanizing shock unprepared.
Why?  I'd gotten so fat
My pants split, just like that!
"No can fix 'em!" Luigi declared.

Will there be something else that you need?
Is that everything? Oh, you exceed
What you brought in your wallet?
"Cash and carry", we call it—
Lack of dough? "Put it back" is our creed.

Casting bronze was a pain to pursue
Till the ancients unveiled cire perdue:
Shape some wax; wrap in clay;
Melt the core wax away.
The now vacated shape's filled anew…

If the finger points up in mistake,
DRS is a step you can take.
Did he bowl a no ball?
Did you hit it at all?
Would it then cause your wicket to break?

My girlfriend is somewhat a sleaze.
"Call me 'Bambi'!" (Her name is Louise.)
"Why that nickname?" "I'm deer!"
"Get the hell out of here!
You're so deer that you spread Lyme disease."

Something inconsequential I'll hallow.
If I have any depth, it lies fallow.
I'm compared, as a rule,
To a child's wading pool.
Or in other words, deep down I'm shallow.

I love every day of the week,
But Friday is always the peak.
It smells like such fun
Because school is all done
Until Monday. And then, I smell geek.

"It's a beautiful day!  Let's decide
How we're going to plan out our ride.
I think that we oughta
Drive close to the water.
The coastal route's best," said the guide.

The bricklayer's starting to mope:
His assistant, that blockheaded dope,
Ordered boatloads of soapstone
To use as a copestone,
And now they'll be struggling to cope.

For the tastiest snack on the playa,
See Ignacio "Nacho" Anaya.
Chips with peppers and cheese
Are certain to please,
So it's Nacho's fine Specials I'll buy ya.

Son, I fear I must ask you to jettison
Your plans to pursue dental medicine.
Dental school lasts forever.
You're young and you're clever;
Become an inventor like Edison!

If you want to engage in an aini,
Stop sitting around on your heinie!
You'll labor for me;
I'll repay you, you'll see.
(That's unless you get kvetchy and whiny.)

My shoulders are rounded—they're courb.
That's an adjective, also a verb,
Which I happen to know
Means "to bend" or "to bow."
Wow, my Webster's is simply superb!

Although people mean yes with amen,
This word also means—straining my ken—
That God notes all my needs,
Sees all human misdeeds,
And comes quickly to judge, God knows when.

The new Tel Aviv talk show was set:
Its most coveted on-air guest yet!
The PM will discourse
On Israeli divorce.
Oh, the viewers that get get will get!

"See the window above that old door?
It's a fanlight — amazing! What's more,
It is shaped like a fan."
"Geez, I'm outta here, man,
I won't hang with a consummate bore."

Unobtrusive am I and discreet;
Not one confidence will I repeat.
I will use words with tact,
Show respect with each act;
With restraint my whole being's replete.

Michael hit for the cycle today
With a powerful batting display:
A single (just one),
Plus a double, home run,
And a triple. Impressive, I'd say.

It's  apple blossom time, says the song,
In New Jersey.  The message is strong,
And it's all about fruit;
But I don't give a hoot,
'Cause New York is the place I belong.

The lights of Las Vegas have flair;
They coruscate, blind with their glare.
You become like the lights —
Gambol days, gamble nights —
As you learn you can scintillate there.

My wife just adores the carnivora,
So for Christmas I thought I would give her a
Bear, as a treat.
To the bear, she was meat —
I got home just in time to deliver her.

Many gridiron coaches agree
That the aerial game is a key.
Have the quarterback throw
And he'll score, doncha know?
As he might, making passes at me!

Yogi Berra, the records have shown,
Has ten Series rings of his own.
He not only could hit,
He was great with the mitt,
Yet for malaprops now he's most known.

Why use preburners, motors? You've got,
In the chamber, a gas that is hot.
Tap it off for the pumps,
And your rocket then jumps
Off the pad into space like a shot.

The Bikini state colours would let
M.O.D. personnel know the threat.
Situations appraised
Could mean threat levels raised
And swift action with which they'd be met.

It was more than a run-of-the-mill cream;
It was made for men's hair — it was Brylcreem.
Just a dab, that would do ya
(The wet look would clue ya).
For a while, it was top-of-the-hill cream.

"The Creator"? Archontics would laugh—
The Creation was done by God's staff,
His creative opinions
Enacted by minions
Who worked on Jehovah's behalf.

In each year you can divvy by four,
Baby-kissers try showing rapport.
Vote-getters have proven
It sure is behooven;
Smart pols kiss cute babies to score.

It's daft: when you die, you bequeath
All your favourite things (like your teeth)
To your kids and your wife,
Who brought much to your life —
Like its end, and a second-hand wreath!

The crapnel was dragging the sound
Till it  suddenly struck a soft mound.
When they hauled up that hunk
It was slimy and stunk.
Had (at last) Jimmy Hoffa been found?

Exposed to a chosen emission,
The substrate achieves a rendition
Of silicon, tin,
Or whatever — it's thin,
Thanks to chemical vapour deposition.

Doing biopsies during arthroscopy?
Or cystoscopy? Maybe gastroscopy?
In celloidin, the tissue
Is steeped in a dish; you
Can slice it real thin for microscopy.

That gee lost five gees on a gee
That ran like a slug. Seemed to be
Under five gees, or drugged
(All geed up). I'd'a slugged
The damn tipster, if it had been me.

The black mamba is one nasty snake,
Whose acquaintance you don't want to make.
Since those who get bitten
With poison are smitten,
They pay for their fatal mistake.

Cortaderia grasses enthrall!
Growing six to a dozen feet tall,
Sporting panicles silky,
Abundant, and milky,
The pampas grass passes them all.

"Kiss me, Hardy," cried Nelson, "I'm shot.
I'm a goner as likely as not.
Like my ship, I'm a wreck...
Keep your hands on the deck,
Sir, and off my most sensitive spot!"

All the work that I did was insane
In preparing to tour sunny Spain.
On arrival, 'twas plain
(Oh, the pain!) there'd be rain —
Those plans went,  like the rain, down the drain.

Tip O'Neill exclaimed, "Bah! Gerry Ford's
A Republican leader. Accord's
Not their style: Won't propose;
They just always oppose —
Those 'againster' contrarian hordes."

You've a liver? It's pumping out bile.
And your other parts? Ichors most vile.
	But the lymph mixed with fat—
	You ain't got none of that?
You're achylous, bud: lacking in chyle.

He will take off his gloves on the Hill,
Fighting bare-knuckle battles with skill.
Unrelenting and fierce
Is Republican Pierce:
Pulling punches is not on the bill.

As two fencers square off for their match,
"A feint," thinks the keen one, "I'll hatch!"
So his foot he stamps quick
To distract.  Thrust and stick!
His appel yields touché—not a scratch!

Each competitor fixes his eyes
On the triumph of winning first prize,
But to win double gold—
Two first prizes—I'm told,
Brings a fame that (one hopes) never dies.

Watching curling, a game with no spice?
Then be ready to yawn once or twice.
The teams slide a large stone,
Sweep it into the zone;
Think of shuffleboard, bocce—on ice!

Her statement is quite in accord
And consists with the evidence stored.
Both the x-rays reveal
That her meal was of steel;
Yes indeed, she did swallow the sword.

Monsieur Pepé Le Pew had a knack
For harassing a cat who was black.
The source of her plight
Was a paint stripe of white
That ran dorsally, straight down her back.

A buffer can counter a trace
Of alkali (a.k.a. base).
Acid and it
Both readily fit
In antalkali's neutral embrace.

The jackhammer Rory employs
Makes a clattering, shattering noise —
With a head-splitting pain,
It's confounding my brain
And destroying my peace and my poise.

T. R., feeling mighty as Zeus,
Said, "I really don't need an excuse.
I will enter the race
For the White House. My base
Is the party we'll call the Bull Moose."

Of Hellenic peninsulas three,
The most easterly's known as Akti.
Macedonia's friend,
It's Chalcidice's end,
Where the monks say their prayers by the sea.

Not quite calyx, but small imitation,
Calyculus (found in carnation)
Sits there like a spare.
So, does anyone care?
Yes, the plantsman in keen observation.

On the cruise ship she's quite the converser,
Which aids in her role as precursor.
She can chatter away
On events of the day
Or the jobs of the captain or purser.

The collect is one way we pray;
It is brief, yet has formal array.
Prithee, still you're perplexed?
Well, it follows a text
That will vary, forsooth, with the day.

There's a crackdown on sugar.  That means
We'll see candy-less vending machines.
Severe measures they'll force
Down our throats.  We of course
Can just starve or eat tofu and greens.

As winter prepares to depart,
Yellow trumpets declare a fresh start.
Their announcement is seen,
More than heard, on the green,
When each daffodil opens its heart.

Manning triremes in old Roman wars
Were synched rowers in three banks of oars.
Triple tiers produced speed;
They were fearsome, indeed,
When they loomed off an enemy's shores.

There's a turd at the foot of the stairs.
And as usual, nobody cares.
'Neath the first step it lies,
Entertaining the flies.
Now, will someone admit that it's theirs?

The mild, tasty, white farmer's cheese,
Made from curds of skim milk (if you please),
Will be usually soured.
At our house it's devoured,
Though an allergy makes us all wheeze.

Facetious is such a great word
Meaning "humorous, funny, absurd."
But I find it compelling
Because of its spelling:
All vowels in their order preferred.

The chief of this crew is Boeotian.
He is dull, without any emotion.
He is stupid and dense—
No more sense than a fence—
Yet revered by his staff with devotion.

When I get a bad stomach I grieve,
Having queasiness hard to believe.
I'll deaerate some Coke
And then drink it (no joke!),
Since with flat stuff I'm not gonna heave.

Sir, you've been diagnosed with a cancer.
Chemotherapy's part of the answer.
For more activation
We'll use radiation,
So your cancer won't make an advance, sir.

"Sure we've met … I've forgotten the place …"
"You're my husband, and I'm your wife, Grace."
Oh, I don't like this game,
But it's always the same:
I just can't put a name to a face.

On a ledge there's no "squeezing in ledgeways";
By a hedge there's no "squeezing in hedgeways".
But sneak in a word
With a chatterbox bird
Then you've managed to "squeeze it in edgeways".

Bloody chunk of raw wood feared by cocks.
Lifting pulley that squeaks at the docks.
Only part of a mass.
Causes failure to pass.
Keeps our stores in a street-bordered box.

At the old Inns of Court in pursuit
Of juridical training, astute
Would-be barristers lifted
Old trials to be sifted.
Such bolting (and moots) are now moot.

With the help of some fitting statistics,
We chart, in contrastive linguistics,
How lingos compare
(Do they differ? And where?)
In their lexicons, grammars, stylistics.

Naval words seem absurd, aye, half-assed,
And they've changed bit by bit as time's passed.
A Dutch order of old
Meaning "put things on hold"
Has evolved:  you will now hear  "Avast!"

Do you dig all that Internet jive?
Without shorthand how could we survive?
If you're really quite proud
To be LOL,
Well then text me a cyber ^5.

Someone broke Auntie May's favorite cup?
And you think that I did it? ...well, yup.
My best move now, I guess,
Would be simply confess.
Yeah, I'd better come clean and fess up.

"I've got candy here. Come, have a piece,"
Said the creepy old man to my niece.
She told the perv "No!"
And then where he could go.
He sped off in a two-door Caprice.

"The Nutcracker Suite" and "The Flight
Of the Bumble Bee" — classical, right?
Hear my rockin' CD
With the Stingers and B.
Bumble's versions; they sound out o' sight.

I shall feed back some feedback that's true
Of the breath that you output:  pee-yoo!
I've a firm diagnosis:
You've foul halitosis.
Don't kiss me, whatever you do.

The public won't back John McCain
'Cause Iraq is a mess?  You're insane!
Then again, what you hear —
An agenda — makes clear
That the press views success with disdain.

As St Sniff's board of governors, we
Have decreed Tristan's in, for a fee.
We provide for the toff—
Let the proles bugger off
To where schools have no class, but they're free.

Gonna give it to someone tonight:
I am itching, by God, for a fight.
When you see me you'll gulp,
Cos I'll beat to a pulp
Any fool who has failed to take flight.

It's carefulness, mindfulness, heed,
And discretion this gambler will need
To exhibit to get
Himself clear of his debt,
But, alas, he's bedeviled by greed.

Bambino is "babe" in Italian.
In a creche or religious medallion
It's the Christ child; in truth,
Fans referred to Babe Ruth
As Bambino (but thought him a stallion).

I chipped at the marble I'd spied.
I sculpted and shaped — how I tried
To create a great work!
When I'd finished, a berk
Yelled "Great work, how'd you know 'twas inside?"

Her countenance, frequently seen
By the people as calm and serene,
When she smiles and shakes hands
Across many far lands,
Rarely falters: the face of the Queen.

In a capitated system, your docs
Make less profit when you're on the rocks.
While you're healthy and strong
They get fees, right along,
But no more when you're down with the pox.

On the day that St. Mark's campanile
Fell to ruins, said Venice: "Big deal, eh?"
They rebuilt it so well
That the tourists can't tell
Just how real is the source of the peal, eh!

With a set of raised dots, Helen Keller
Could read with her fingers. How stellar!
Her heart might just fail
If she knew there was braille
On machines at the bank's drive-thru teller.

Who in hell in the Bible's Abiah?
Lowly wife or monarchic high-flier?
It depends in which book
You should happen to look
(Her/his name means "The Lord is my sire").

The attainment of physical beauty,
To Greeks, was each citizen's duty.
Callipygian is what
They considered a butt
Like Beyoncé's bodacious patootie.

As a cougar,  I'm less than a ten,
And I don't look like Barbie (more Ken).
Though I'd like to look youthful,
To be wholly truthful,
I'll never see thirty again.

Huge words need the patience of Job.  Ya
Get scared in your pre-frontal lobe. Ya
Bone up, but it's grim
Cramming words in a lim:
Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia.

"In the case of The World v. O'Connor,
I will act as attorney, Your Honor,
For myself." The judge sighed
As he calmly replied,
"You're a moron and surely a goner."

An advantage to baldness, I note,
Is my dandruff concerns are remote.
Now my scalp has no flakes,
And it shines — all it takes
Is a clear polyurethane coat!

The Bolshoi's a famous ballet.
All its dancers can leap and plié;
And the star in the corps,
Boris Borzoi, can soar
When he raises his leg en fouetté.

The attic at Wit's End contains
An enormous collection of trains.
There's track in it too,
Like the station at Crewe,
So the Phelpses can play when it rains.

Countless shapes, all from paper, he'd cut.
Then he'd paste them all over his butt.
After that, he'd go crackers
With varnish and lacquers:
A certified decoupage nut.

My hopes for grand images fizzle
When I gaze up at Caelum, the Chisel.
This piece of the sky
That was named by Lacaille
Looks like nothing, as many of his'll.

Having paid him a generous price,
We received this ex gratia advice:
"Be prepared for surprises;
The old creek sometimes rises—
Just a pointer, you know, to be nice."

Trading votes on the House floor was why
Dick Gephardt was heard to decry:
"You misunderstand,
No revenge is at hand.
I just wanted an aye for an aye."

A dentist named Keith I once knew
Gave advice that I think is quite true:
"Every day," advised Keith,
"You be true to your teeth,
Or else they will be false unto you."

Aggravated's a type of assault,
An offense with a nasty gestalt.
Hope that perp with the axe
Gets the max for attacks;
It's time this crime came to a halt.

These are dust covers draped on your chair
And the sofas that furnish your lair,
When you've gone, on your own,
To explore parts unknown,
And your home is alone—no one's there.

The broadcast you heard on art deco,
Or flamenco as danced by J. Greco—
Signals all bounced to ground
Off a satellite round:
A balloon, and the first one was Echo.

A bushed roller consists of a pin
That's constrained by a housing within
Which it turns in a sleeve,
With the aim to achieve
A mechanically frictionless spin.

"Such enjoyment I get riding ferries —
Why, shuttling's a great bowl of cherries!"
"Not I. For to go
Back and forth, to and fro,
Is too boring: the route rarely varies."

Keeper's gloved it — "HOWZZAT! Caught behind?"
The old ump shakes his head. (Shouldn't mind,
But we all heard the nick,
The sharp [click] of a snick;
And saw movement.  This ump's deaf and blind.)

How unfair! Emmetropic Aunt Joan
(So dubbed as her vision is known
To be perfect) espies
Any motes in our eyes,
While ignoring the beams in her own.

AKM is a name some may know
As AK-47. Although
It is old in design,
Still this rifle fires fine,
As some terrorist groups love to show.

Says our town's anti-nuke pamphleteer:
"Any time, now, disaster is near:
The reactor protection's
Been failing inspections;
The containment's degrading, I fear."

In a cup made of bone ash are holes.
Ore is heated inside it; out rolls
Molten lead.  Silver stays
In the coppel, reweighs
At its troy weight, less tare weight controls.

H. C. Andersen's fairytales range
From the quaint to the wonderfully strange.
And the poor ugly duck
Who outgrew his ill luck
Still gives children some hope by this change.

Cinderella felt just a bit glum,
As her sisters both drooled, "What a bum!
See our pics of the ball—
They're all up on the wall.
We said one day our prints (groan!) would come."

A part of the actor's biography
Was a carefully written filmography
That included each role
He had played, on the whole—
But omitted his stint in pornography.

Cinnamaldehyde's scent makes its mark.
It's extracted from cinnamon bark.
Have some fun. Feed your hon
A sweet cinnamon bun;
Let your nose find her lips in the dark!

A banneret's leading his knights
In one of their regular fights.
If he wins, he may yet
Be a new baronet
When the King performs post-battle rites.

Curtail may refer to a slur
When the tail you curtail's on a cur,
'Cos you were, by concurring
To spurn it, inferring
The cur's not a cur you prefer.

Respiration involves inhalation
Continuing till its cessation,
When our fast-cooling meat
Matches ambient heat
On the date of our great expiration.

Quasimodo was tolling and fell
To the street with a boing, I hear tell.
What a sound! Gather round!
Who's that man on the ground?
I've a hunch that his face rings a bell.

There's an island that's so antigay
You face lynching or jail . . . Such dismay!
It's a place where poor Stella
Got her "groove" till her fella
Said, "I'm reading the lines of a play."

With natural (no fan) convection,
Heat moves in an upward direction.
But convection that's forced
By a fan's here endorsed:
Aim the heat at your feet. (Ah, perfection!)

Graduation's a time for great cheers,
When you celebrate ending four years
Academically spent
Building skills to pay rent.
We'll all toast to your health—with some beers!

This Malayan's a dwarf, very small,
And has clubfoot, but that isn't all.
In this guy from Malaysia,
Diastrophic dysplasia
Means his bones may well break, should he fall.

In ancient times, one might assign a
Fine name that implies a divine, a
Sublime and not bestial
Source; thus Celestial
Empire's the best name for China.

Cynicalness? Sid's is quite plain.
He looks down on the world with disdain.
His contemptuous sneer
Makes us cross, as it's clear
His complaints are completely inane.

"It's a far better…." "Non! A la carte!"
"So, the tumbril's about to depart?"
"Non! The menu! Each dish
Priced and listed — the fish?"
"No, the chop. I'll have that for a start."

Its distinguishing features are these:
It both looks like and keeps away fleas.
But its optimal use
Is to shake your bowels loose.
Defecation with fleawort?  A breeze!

What a wonderful story to tell.
Thank you, Verdi, for casting a spell.
Drag a girl from the south
Near the Nile's hungry mouth—
That's Aida, a true Memphis belle.

Use our aggregator. Sooner or later
Your collection need's bound to grow greater.
Our app's touted mission
Cements our position
As "the blogosphere's data curator."

I'd an invite, a party well fraught
With politicos, all of them bought.
To circulate in
'Mongst the villains of sin:
Check my grin; hope I never get caught!

There's new software to figure your tax:
Enter numbers, sit back and relax.
Getting all legal breaks,
Watch the time that it takes
Cut from hours to five minutes max!

An acranius hasn't the hull
That is commonly known as the skull.
A fetus like this
Will undoubtedly miss
Growing up to be somebody dull.

On my clock, hear the hourly chime:
West (by six zones) of Greenwich, the Prime
(And two east of Pacific).
I think it's terrific...
The time of my life? Central Time.

A strike or a spare every frame
Is a goal for which bowlers will aim,
And no matter the dirt
On your face or your shirt,
If you do it, it's called a clean game.

I purchased a brand new Beretta;
Shot my wife, now I hope to forgetta.
This verse is a clue:
You'd have done the same, too.
Self-reference? You'd know if you'd meta.

So let's say you've a beautiful arsenate
(That's AsO4 if you're parsin' it).
Tack on some Ca.
MgOH? Okay!
That's adelite! Our earth is sparse in it.

When choosing a bottle of wine,
Any Cabernet Franc is divine.
Its peppery nose
And taste often goes
With Saumon aux Poireaux when I dine.

Ashawagandha: this plant claims some cures
Of infections and leprosy  sores;
Promotes sleep, relieves stress,
Boosts your energy (yes!)—
Ayurvedics ensure it endures.

My defense for that murderous crime
Was diminished capacity.  I'm
Only serving two years,
'Cause a jury of peers
Bought the claim I was nuts at the time.

Said the ad: "Runt for sale".  I, surprised,
Saw a pup that was normal, full-sized —
Sized just right for her type
And her age.  I'd no gripe,
So my face lit with joy undisguised.

Your antibodies make you immune,
Like a malady-fighting platoon.
With field expertise
In defeating disease,
They'll protect you at Sal's Greasy Spoon.

Anoxaemia, altitude sickness,
Affects one's good judgement and quickness.
The lead climber says, "Yo,
Down the mountain you go!"
(And you can't blame the dude for his strictness.)

Absolve means to set free from blame
(Or acquit, which is nearly the same)
One who's falsely accused,
Or unjustly ill-used,
With no actual truth in the claim.

I've hoped that I'd never estrange
You, by taking control to arrange
That your life remain cheerful,
But lately I'm fearful.
You're turning away from each change.

The wine in these glasses we're clinking
Is fruity and sweet: easy-drinking.
High in alcohol?  No.
So the chances are low
We'll get drunk to the point that we're stinking.

After losing his job, in lament he
Said, "Agism? I have seen plenty.
'Help wanted,' ads say,
'Please apply here, today!'
But only for those who look twenty."

The word fulsome meant "loaded", "profuse";
That was then, but the meaning got loose.
Now it's "odious", "vile".
"Fulsome praise"? Makes me smile —
Phony flattery fools the obtuse.

What's that tongue-twister mean? I'm just beat.
"Worse condition or quality."  Sweet!
They've culled deteriority
From the majority
Of lexicons — isn't that meet?

They annoy me: I think they're a pain,
And their thoughtlessness drives me insane.
At the grocery store
They're the ones who buy more
Than twelve things in the ten-item lane.

A babblative person will patter
And gibber and jabber and chatter
And gabble and prattle
And babble and tattle
And blather and rattle and natter.

There's this term for our kind—baby-boomer:
We have aged, gotten rich (there's a rumor),
But I'm not so well-heeled.
My lame life has revealed
That I'm slow to succeed, a late bloomer.

A propeller can cause the creation
Of bubbles, whose manifestation
Appears to be boiling
In water that's roiling.
The process is called cavitation.

Just use money to make money, Joe.
They say, gelt gait zu gelt, and it's so:
Show a bloke your fat roll,
He sheds all self-control,
And it's easy to watch your green grow.

Once unwrapped, Angie angrily rent
The container in which she'd been sent.
"I'm distressed, not impressed,
To have been UPS'ed!
Did you think that's what angiogram meant?"

Here's a photo I treasure like gold
That is over a hundred years old.
Production increased when
Perfected by Eastman —
It's known as a dry plate, I'm told.

The Christmas lights draped on the tree
Hang loosely—so lovely to see!
But the children are stewing,
As Papa says, "Viewing
Is set at a $10 fee."

I want to get in on this game.
It's a field where I might make my name:
Knitting squares (got the bug!)
For the World's Biggest Rug —
What — they've got it sewn up? What a shame!

Antigovernment Anne, a librarian,
Likes neither George Bush nor John Kerry, an'
She wants you to note
That she's casting her vote
For a long shot who's more libertarian.

"Our burn rate of cash is too high —
If we spend at this pace we'll run dry.
Plus we've used all our credit."
The sad way that Jack said it,
We'll be kissing our business goodbye.

When I text her a joke that I know,
She bottomlessly lets herself go.
The response from my child
Lets me see she's gone wild:
ROTF & LMAO!!!

It's an isle now belonging to Italy,
Where Boney was banished. He wittily
Ordered peach Melba
While living on Elba.
This cannot be true, but reads prettily.

In their courtlet (small court), Lou drinks beers.
He yells, "Love ya!" out loud. His wife hears.
"Who's that talking, dear, you?
Or the beer?" she asks Lou.
He says, "Me, to th' beer, hun, ah fears."

Of the physicist Sadi Carnot,
People said, "There's a man in the knot!"
Was he great as Hans Bethe,
Though Bethe lived lathe?
Some think so, while others say, "Not!"

He's a swine who would trample a pearl,
And his language might make your hair curl.
He's an ill-tempered boor,
Antisocial for sure;
In a word, you could call him a churl.

Lota lota, the eel-mother, shouts
To her brood of young lawyers, "You sprouts,
You are eelpouts and burbots,
Not eels or young turbots.
Act like freshwater cod!"  And she pouts.

Check your attitude! Is it despair,
Disapproval, disdain, scorn or prayer?
Stop your eye-rolling, do!
One more time and we're through.
Use your words, not your dumb upward stare.

Most donuts are round, like a tire,
And cooked in a fat-laden fryer.
They're cake-like or doughy
And sometimes quite showy,
But holes they don't always require.

I'm torpedoed and, surely, I'm sinking:
Someone's messed with my woman, I'm thinking.
She's been acting right weird;
Now she's flat disappeared—
A dead cat on the line… and it's stinking.

I stayed up very late in the night.
With sleep, I gave up — lost the fight.
Yes, sleep got my number;
I sure needed slumber  —
Like that, I went out like a light.

The garçon brings a sweet vin d'Alsace
With the bill at Café Montparnasse.
"What a cool coup de GRAH!"
You exclaim—a faux pas
In pronouncing the phrase coup de grâce.

Acrisorcin's a cure for a yeast
That drops in on your skin for a feast.
It's nasty in tots:
Bleaches skin into spots.
But the treatment won't hurt in the least.

A sprinter was beaten by ploys in
A race with a tough Illinoisan—
A flash who talked trash
In the hundred-yard dash.
(One man's meet is another man's poison.)

"Eager beavers say, 'Yes sir! Yes ma'am!'
While they race for success," opined Sam.
"Seems your lodge-ic is flawed.
They don't cry when i-gnawed.
Seems they wood," I replied, "give a dam!"

An aperitif starts our fine meal,
Then a chilled Chardonnay has appeal.
Let's open a red
Before going to bed.
A Pinot might just be ideal.

Maybe arrowheads (pop name) should go;
That misnomer's a whopper, you know:
Some are spear points—on top
Of an arrow, they'd drop
To the ground and could chop off your toe!

They've dressed leather, these folk, all their lives,
And a family tradition survives.
In one bigamist's house is
The help of two spouses—
Three cheers for that currier and wives.

Beware, girls: your lashes aflutter
Lead from flirting straight into the gutter.
He'll think that you're easy,
Your morals are sleazy,
Unless "It's an eye tic," you mutter.

In the cattywhompus house that I built,
A mad architect's marbles were spilt.
It was based on the bevel
Instead of the level —
Chaotic and skewed, with a tilt.

An octogenarian bird
Thought that giving up sex was absurd.
So she programmed an app
That she kept on her lap-
-top: "Remind me next March twenty-third."

Classic poet they say that I'm notta,
Though free verse I don't write a lotta.
Since blank verse has meter,
It sounds a bit sweeter,
But rhyming with meter I gotta.

Up to now, we've not formally met,
And we can't use first names, not just yet.
These constraints can be loosed
Once we've been introduced—
Now get back into bed, Miss Fayette.

Legs are bent, head is bowed, back is curved—
One prenatal or person unnerved?
Is it inside its mama
Or suffering trauma?
The term fetal position's reserved.

The concluders have reached their conclusion:
The phenomenon's merely illusion.
I quote them verbatim:
"We've studied each datum.
And found no support for cold fusion."

Cézanne was an artist whose style
Fathered Cubism. Heard of him? I'll
Bet you'd like his still life,
And his landscapes are rife
With rich colors. They surely beguile.

I hate violence—I made it my mission:
Make a G-rated cutdown edition
Of Saw, but my edits
Left only the credits
And that old FBI admonition.

Now, what do you call this condition:
Two nouns in a row? Apposition.
If you want an e.g.,
Say "numeral three."
You will now have accomplished your mission.

Discontinued since two thousand two
(Why they did that, I don't have a clue).
Like the Mustang from Ford,
On the road it just soared:
I miss the Camaro, don't you?

A Commissioner of Oaths duly swears
The deponents of documents. There's
Some solemnity: "Do
You affirm your word's true?
Sign and date." (These are formal affairs.)

Too much sediment causes the beds
Of streams to aggrade as it spreads.
This may spoil the wishes
Of some of the fishes
If streams cannot cover their heads.

These "congers" aren't eels — they have legs
(Well, vestigial, eensy-toed pegs).
Got no eyelids nor tongue.
Though deserting their young,
Amphiumidae cherish their eggs.

In a human resource occupation
A demographist studies a nation.
He reports upon both
Variations and growth
He observes in the real population.

Captain Smee was unable to see
With his eye on the right, so that he
Had impaired depth perception.
Committing subreption,
He said, "I'm deficiency-free!"

Random publishers never rose higher
Than Bennett (plays heaven's first lyre).
What's his line? Pun my word!
When he died, heaven heard
"Cerf's up!" from a wag in the choir.

William Franklin was governor, head
Of New Jersey. The Tories he led.
When arrested and jailed,
Plans to hang the guy failed:
"Were it not for your dad, you'd be dead!"

Akaryotic, a small, one-celled creature
Displayed an unfortunate feature:
It was nucleus-free,
Somewhat heartless, you see
(Like Miss Manheim, my algebra teacher).

The exfoliant agent Clear Skin
Is to acne as God is to sin,
Blasting every dead cell
(And some live ones as well);
So it does what it says on the tin.

Joe's againstism's misunderstood;
He says "no" to whatever looks good,
And things that look bad
Make him equally mad.
(He'd be shunning himself if he could.)

Trading stocks on a foreign exchange
(Called a bourse) can be risky and strange.
There's a stove-making firm
That has promise long-term,
But it trades in a limited range.

"Quick-march!" Sergeant screams, and then sneers:
"Will you ever become Infanteers?"
Then it pains him to say it—
"Break-step!" Don't delay it;
This bridge might collapse round our ears.

It was called the Great War. For four years
It caused combatants blood, sweat, and tears.
What we call World War I
Stunned the world at Verdun.
They will never forget, it appears.

As our priest made the case for salvation,
His passions arose; escalation
Of tone and intensity
Increased my propensity
To escalate Sunday's donation.

An investor writes in from Decatur:
"Can you say why my profits aren't greater
When the market is strong?"
As we've warned all along,
Watch that spread that they've tagged alligator!

Many buttresses slope on the top,
Then run up to a building and stop.
Architectural geeks
(All amortizement freaks)
Talk of piers with their peers at the shop.

Alassio sits on the sea,
An Italian resort that to me
Is the place for romance
And an evening of dance,
Even topping the Isle of Capri.

The pen that I use is a Bic.
It is plastic and looks like a stick—
Not too slick or exciting—
But limerick writing?
A flick of my Bic does the trick.

Your bookseller's backlist, I'm told,
Lists the books that are classic or old.
Not the new-published tomes
Some may take to their homes,
But the titles your grandfather sold.

The broadcasts and newspapers pull
The same tales from their bag till I'm full.
Stories drone on forever,
Ad nauseam. Never
Repeat them, please—cut all the bull.

A calyptra, or membranous hood,
Can be found on the moss in the wood.
It sits over the case
Of a spore in a place
You can see—if your eyesight is good.

In a book shop, I'm stunned, brought to tears,
When a fabulous relic appears:
A pristine Ainsworth Psalter.
"However," I falter,
"Has it lasted these four hundred years?"

In its tough little acorn-shaped shell
This wee barnacle's happy to dwell
In the ocean. He's stuck
To the rocks, where he'll tuck
Into plankton, and weather the swell!

The male tiger, now fully enraged,
With great fury had growled; unassuaged
By the "Ooh!"s of the crowd
And the "Ah!"s, he roared loud
In frustration at being encaged.

A man who resided in Harwich
Found motorcars fit to disparage.
Say people who knew 'im,
He favored the brougham
And rode in a horse-driven carriage.

Nick Clegg, Britain's leading Lib Dem,
Has a nebulous role: DPM.
Rest assured, nothing sinister:
He's Deputy Prime Minister—
An important position. (Ahem.)

On the Spanish guitar my technique
Of unamplified strums is unique.
I acoustically play
In my singular way,
Causing strings to detune and to squique.

It's allergy season again
And carrot weed (bane of all men)
Is making us sneeze.
But it must please the bees,
'Cause the pollen count's five thousand ten!

Here's my counterconditioning tool:
I've been swimming each day in the pool
To help conquer the fear
(Idiotic, it's clear)
That I'll drown in a bucket of drool.

That a nearly invisible bite
From a spider should lead to this plight
Has us shaking our heads.
Arachnidism spreads,
A necrosis with no end in sight.

Coming back to this country, it's lax
To forget to own up and pay tax
On all dutiable stuff.
You'll be treated quite rough
If you don't and be fined to the max!

Of the Garden of Eden I write:
Prelapsarian gem where two might,
Anteceding the Fall,
Have stayed pure, had it all —
Of an apple, instead, took a bite.

All your theories are widely dismissed.
Your predictions fall flat. Please desist!
Clouds can not tell you when
We'll be shaking again.
"Earthquake weather" just doesn't exist!

'Gainst Cape Wrath every element tilts.
Seabirds huddle in feathery quilts.
Piercing winds howl and rage
At each seasonal stage,
And the locals hold tight to their kilts!

"If you wanted to churn, then make butter!"
I yell at my broker, who'll utter
Excuses for churning
My stocks, which are turning
So much, my account's in the gutter.

Though Jewish, I envy your Easter;
On Cadbury Eggs I'm a feaster.
They're chocolate and smooth,
And my mood they will soothe.
(But they'll add too much weight to my keister!)

At age one he was mauled by a duck,
Then at two in some quicksand got stuck.
At age three he got rabies…
There are really no maybes,
Little Roy was the king of bad luck.

Two distichs occur in a row
In these lines, and those written below.
Think two "A"s and two "B"s,
And the meaning's a breeze —
They are couplets, a term you should know.

I've been called to a meeting you're chairing,
And I know you'll be quite overbearing.
You think you're so clever —
But I know, however,
The mistakes that you make will be glaring.

Dame Judith Olivia Dench,
You're an actress I'd quite like to clench.
With an Oscar and Tony,
You're surely no phony.
Mmmmm-MWAH! There's a kiss for you (French)!

When King David saw gorgeous Bathsheba,
He exclaimed, "She is cuter than Reba!
She's like J. Lo. Like wow!
I shall sleep with her now."
Was that sinful? Ask Rabbi Akiba.

The aitchbone's a cut of a steak
That's great with some fries and a shake.
The "aitch" ain't for "hearty"
Or "Hey, folks, let's party"—
It's shaped like an "H," for God's sake!

I erroneously thought she adored me;
In fact, it turns out, she abhorred me.
It was such a surprise
When she kneed (hard!) the rise
In my jeans; despite cries, she ignored me.

Azotemia's protein collecting
Cuz the kidneys aren't good at perfecting.
The glomerular filter
Is so out of kilter,
His frost-colored skin is reflecting!

L'chaim! Mazel tov! Girl, you're it!
You're now a bath mitzvah, legit.
You chanted the Torah
And now, kenahorah,
For adulthood you're finally fit!

This tame kitty's no wild desert lynx
That still roams near the sands of the Sphinx.
No, this fake bobcat pet
Ain't related. You get
Just a cross-breeder's ruse, and that stinks.

Yes, I like you a lot, and you'll see
If I like you some more I will be
On your case to soft-soap you
To let me come grope you —
It's fond, fonder, fondle for me.

There's the class of a shiny brass band,
Sunday concerts all over the land,
Then the marching band's blare,
And some jazzy affair,
Also marches of Sousa—all grand!

Though you're lushly curvaceous, I fear
You are younger than you may appear,
And an innocent man
Could wind up in the can,
So hands off!  Do I make myself clear?

My doctor took time to explain
Why I suffered severe headache pain.
"Cerebritis is what
I'm afraid you have got:
Inflammation," (My luck!) "of the brain."

The Duke of York had to resign,
His unsuitable friends crossed the line.
Now the ten thousand men
Have been paid off again,
Is our monarchy on the decline?

Grandpa thinks he's the Sugar Plum Fairy,
Though his tutu's decidedly scary.
His ballet every year
Brings us holiday cheer,
But the neighbors are watchful and wary.

In the Bronze Age, men already knew
How to make one new metal from two.
Blending copper and tin,
That was how to begin;
Better weapons the object in view.

M'lady, fflo Phelps hasn't yet
Come to terms with the fact that her pet
Uses teeth when he fights
And draws blood as he bites
All comers, including the vet.

Your new girlfriend is acting quite snooty;
Though she's not what I'm calling a beauty,
With her head-lice, your love
Is reminding me of
Less a cutie, good bud, than a cootie.

There was an old man with a beard—
Shaved it off! Said, "It's just as I feared:
I'm no longer a haven
For birds, now I'm shaven.
They've scarpered; they've all disappeared."

My mother employed CIO
So in time all her kids learned to go
Right to sleep. There's no doubt,
She opined cry it out
Was effective, although it caused woe.

I dated my patient.  No more.
Our relationship's health was quite poor.
With our history rough
And no physical stuff,
I thought, "What am I seeing her for?"

"Our Bootlegger's gone," Frankie fumed,
"So our booze-lovers' luncheon is doomed!
Drinkers love to get at
Aged cheeses like that
Since with whiskey it's often consumed."

My friend Pete loves his meat; he's a glutton
For chops, whether veal, pork or mutton.
When his wife chops up meat
To make meatballs to eat,
He repeats, "Gimme chops, or serve nuttin'!"

Classic cars are the stars of the show—
Vintage autos for fans in the know.
The Concours d'Elegance
Has Delages, Duponts,
And Pierce-Arrows. (I drive a Peugeot.)

I am sure you'll be happy to learn
There are thousands of species of fern.
Though these plants don't grow flowers,
Some have curative powers,
And at times public notice they earn.

If you measured my hairs on two days
Of their follicles' anagen phase,
You'd conclude on the strength
Of an increase in length
That they flourished (but what's with the grays?).

When my spouse said I'd ought to be buckled
(Although, in the outcome, I'd truckled),
I'd not laughed, howled, or cawed,
Nor convulsed, nor guffawed;
But I'd inwardly smiled and just chuckled.

Entelechy means "actuality":
Not potential, but more like reality;
Not a mere possibility
Proposed with civility,
But accomplished with honest finality.

For a while, every spot on the dial
Would show candidate Clinton "on trial."
"I once tried to get high,
But inhale? No, not I!"
Did he think we would buy this denial?

'Twas a steam engine incline inclined
That the Union Pacific designed.
Its size clearly stated,
And though bottom plated,
This Big Boy has a tender behind.

With setbacks besetting my lover
And storm clouds collecting above her,
She shows her facility
For bouncebackability,
Finding a way to recover.

For dieters, celery sticks
Unadorned are quite often their picks.
For me, they're unutt'rable
Unless peanut-butt'rable.
Even then, they'll provoke many "icks."

When you exit the restroom, observe
All the protocols. Caution will serve,
As you don't want to hear
Someone say with a leer,
"Hey, your barn door is open, you perv!"

Despite taxes, the mud and the fleas,
I think life as a serf is a breeze.
I would take up the sword
Anytime, for my lord —
Don't defeudalize me, if you please.

"Butter cookies? My goodness!!" Dad yelps
At his daughter young Peggy Sue Phelps.
"So much butter? I'm mad!"
She said, "Calm yourself, Dad.
You don't have to be mad. Butter helps!"

Dimensionless units may reek
Of a trekkie's bizarre techno-speak,
But if you fine-tune it,
The amagat unit
Will prove you're a helluva geek.

I've a constant companion in bed;
She's a bottle of sweet Dago red,
'Cause it's syrupy, cheap,
And it puts me to sleep.
Still I long for a woman instead.

I'm enfeloned (enraged) by these bees.
By withholding their honey, they tease.
This imbues me with choler.
In fury I holler:
"My toast's getting cold. Hurry please!"

Adversariness signifies foes,
With positions that clash or oppose.
Choosing peace over strife,
I defer to my wife—
When she yanks on the ring in my nose.

See that chab? He's been pecking away
At my favorite tree every day.
He is looking for bugs—
Things like beetles, not slugs—
But my tree's showing signs of decay.

Either femoral artery's not
A most wonderful place to get shot,
Because blood vessels near
To your thigh bones are dear.
If one's severed, your chances aren't hot!

He scorned me and drove me to drnk.
I was stricken with grief, on the brnk
Of a fathomless well,
And heard, as it fell,
The sound of his ring. It went chnk.

In the tropics, caciques freely mock,
Sing, and warble in oriole talk,
Weaving nests near wasps' hives
To defend tiny lives—
Red-hot mama caciques really rock!

He averred that we'd quickly be wed
Just as soon as he took me to bed.
So I said to the lad,
"Now I see you're a cad!
You should be a cadaver instead."

Sir Henry, a hard-drinking vicar,
Slouched cellarward, candle aflicker.
Its flame, though not bright,
Shed light on his plight:
He'd guzzled the last of his liquor.

En français, mon chéri (parlez-vous?),
When there's many a thing, there's beaucoup.
From that language Romantic
It crossed the Atlantic.
We use it in English now, too.

They met when her troubles were rife;
He declared, "You're the love of my life."
In moments of leisure
He took her for pleasure.
He lied—and it cut like a knife.

Despite pleas, legal process won't stop,
And tomorrow your body should drop—
As a crack-halter, though,
You're a failure. I know,
'Cause you made an identity swap!

Oh, the accent in music, it looks
Like a V that was knocked down by crooks.
What it says? "Hit me hard!
I don't care if I'm scarred!
The composer intends it, you schnooks!"

Amusement is luring me here.
A well-done little verse I revere.
Writing lim'ricks is fun.
When these short tales are spun,
I am happy and filled with good cheer.

When they said you were lighter than air,
Did you wonder or not really care
How they knew? By the way,
How much does the air weigh?
See aerometer measurements there.

Blind dating's a matter of taste.
At those times when I felt most disgraced,
I would say of the date
That was dealt me by fate
That her bustline was less than her waist.

When our Queens Camerata is heard
Playing Mozart, emotions are stirred.
Just the few heed our call;
I can't claim we're for all,
Even many — that would be absurd.

Avocado hand—what can that mean?
Are your fingers all turning dark green?
No, it's caused, I submit,
By a knife and a pit
When your hand somehow gets in between.

I fancy your fine fiancée.
I'm sorry to say this today
Of all days, but she's hot.
Treat her right 'cause, if not,
I've a notion to steal her away.

"Yer a cretinoid joik!  I jus' hoid
Ya been skimmin' the till, dat's the woid.
If I fine dis is true,
Ain't no doubt whud ul do —
Pudda bullid in you, numbnut toid!"

I graze thousands of sheep on my land,
And they all love to swing. It's just grand.
As their ears get tattooed,
Speakers blare "In the Mood"
And each thousand's a big baa-baa band.

Ashkenazic Jews' language is real.
It's contributed words such as spiel —
Also matzos and shtick,
Schmendrick, goyim, and glik,
Meshugina, gelt, and schlemiel.

There are body blows thrown in the ring—
They're permitted when pugilists swing.
But a punch that is felt
Much below a man's belt
Is taboo for the pain it can bring.

You phony! You said you could play
The trombone in a sweet, pleasant way.
Okay, euphonize this —
Your honk honk ain't worth piss.
Take a lesson or ten — make my day.

Don't mock us again or, no doubt, you
Should worry.  We'll threaten to out you.
If we dox you (ID
You online), you will see
That the public will know all about you.

Ever-mounting bills have me upset;
My arrears are a cause of regret.
But I've paid what I can;
Now my suicide plan
Makes me pray for forgiveness of debt.

I'm sorry, please pardon me, do.
I regret that I cheated on you.
Pray accept my oration
Of lush excusation.
It grieves me that none of it's true.

Since my knowledge of treatment is muddy,
I'm taking a course with my buddy
To explore the extremities
Of medicines, remedies:
An advanced acologic-type study.

"Am I steatopygous in this?"
"Does her bum look big," softly I hiss.
My trainee: "No, Ma'am. My guess,
You look calli-pygous."
(Her sale; my commission. Oh, bliss.)

Tax-exempt status?  Not for the groups
On the right, like the "patriot" troops.
Favored lot they are not.
No exception they got.
Now the Revenue Service says, "Oops."

So few feminine names start with "U".
Well, there's Uma and Uta, that's two.
"One could say that statistically,"
Uttered Tom, euphemistically,
"It's a letter girls' parents eschew."

"The vasectomy won't hurt your vigor,"
Said my doc, "Or your thingamajigger."
Though it's blanks I now shoot,
Something doesn't compute,
'Cause I'm way, way too quick on the trigger.

Bahasa (of where?) Indonesia
Is a language. I don't mean to tease ya',
But for vocab and use,
You will need a kamus;
"Dictionary", if English would please ya'.

My 8-page report was ill-fated:
Got spilled on the floor, not collated.
I must rake up the leaves,
That is, bring in the sheaves —
Put in orderly form, 1-to-8'd.

So how do you like my flat cap?
Now, don't give me a whole lot of crap!
This cloth hat, with stiff bill,
Is patterned in twill;
Do I look like a gent — or a sap?

The flamingo is awkwardly tall.
One was eating; I thought she would fall
In the lake where she fed
When she upturned her head:
The ungainliest bird's feat of all.

Stan ran poorly at first. In a later race
He improved and could run at a greater pace.
As coach of the track team
I'm training a crack team,
Recording their times in my database.

I'm a vital young man in my prime:
A creature of form so sublime.
Yet I've always feared Death,
Who will force my last breath,
And it's said he could come anyti

A codger who lived through the Crash
Is terribly close with his cash.
He tips in small trickles
Of pennies and nickels,
Lamenting each dent in his stash.

Has that Chanticleer romanced the chickens?
Have those biddies become easy pickin's?
Candle eggs with a light—
There are signs there, all right,
That that rooster's been raising the dickens!

This elliptical workout machine
Has me sweating in hopes to be lean.
It's like crossing the ocean,
This cyclical motion—
I'm sea-sick, and fast turning green.

I hear constant complaints from my spouse
Who despises our new duplex house,
Says the neighbors upstairs
Scrape the floors with their chairs.
But we'll stay and I'll let the louse grouse!

"Should I give my wee baby a dummy?
The advice I receive is so crummy!
Will his teeth become wonky,
So he looks like a donkey?"
"I'm just two; dinnae fash yersel', Mummy."

Whenever the rain wants to fall,
Whether drizzle, hard downpour, or squall,
The catchments will catch it,
And promptly dispatch it
To storage — a boon to us all.

"No such word", she had marked against "creditress"
On the draft of "In Debt, Man", his Fed address.
In his speech at the Bank
(The Reserve) will he thank
And express a man's debt to his editress?

To a half-quart of aimless narration,
Add a teaspoon of pure deviation;
Stir in one cup digression,
And a random impression;
Heat, simmer and serve: divagation.

The bilbos were swords used by swordsmen
Who fought for their lieges—the lord's men—
While bimbos are gals
Guys solicit as pals,
As they're prone to be liberal towards men.

We each have ten trillion at least.
They constitute plant, man and beast;
Each one chugging away,
All night and all day —
Without them all life would have ceased.

When Han Solo takes on Boba Fett,
In a carbonite prison he's set.
So now pity poor Han,
The anthropolith man.
He's as stiff as the living can get.

After Christmas I find I'm replete;
I'm so round that I can't see my feet!
Like a sphere I am shaped—
I'm so globulous draped
On my sofa! Please, nothing to eat!

A back street will sometimes extend
To a banjo, a type of dead-end
That's of circular plan
But so small, no car can
Turn round cleanly — it's too tight a bend.

At this college, I've suffered frustration.
Now I'm taking a key examination
In my chemistry class.
It's a test I must pass;
If I don't, I'll be placed on probation.

Frank played football, the source of his woes:
Fractured spine, twisted knee, broken nose.
Now he's E-D-D-U,
But that's all he can do.
He's not ready just yet for the pros.

Her grooming last winter was lax.
At the mirror now, not wearing slacks,
She alerts her salon:
"With this bathing suit on,
I am fimbriate—time for a wax!"

So, can I tell the future? You bet!
Ceraunoscopy's easy. No sweat!
See those skies that we're under?
That lightning and thunder
Tell me that we're gonna get wet.

If the stuff in your bowels has amassed,
Crappuccinos will help it pass fast.
Just warm prunes (as in juice),
Drink with butter (profuse),
Hear your feces shout out, "Free at last!"

I'm a couch surfer; friends of mine say
That I'm wasting my lifetime away:
I just sit here, you see,
Watching loads of TV;
That's the way that I spend my whole day.

Much more than quick wit and long legs,
There's passion about CJ Cregg's
Hard work on West Wing,
When the press does their thing.
She shows heart when it's Danny who begs.

The acknowledgments page in a book
Is to thank all those people who took
 Of their valuable time
 To peruse your small rhyme.
So I thank you, you lovable schnook.

This oil of the almond is bitter,
And a poison for human or critter,
But Amarine still
Is the name of a pill.
One would think they could find something fitter.

As a dandy, he's head of the class,
With conceit that no fop can surpass.
Pour champagne in your flute,
Then stand up and salute:
Lift your glass to this coxcombly ass!

Some lawyers cause lexical strife;
With jargon, their business is rife.
Take baron and feme—
It's used only by them,
While most others say  husband and wife.

Every spring the one thing that is strange is,
Without fail, my friend rearranges
Each room in her house.
"Every March," says her spouse,
"She insists that she must ring the changes."

As a lexical lyricist, I
May admit to a satisfied sigh
When I find words like crunkle,
Whose sputter and spunk'll
Delight those who've heard a crane cry.

My dairy vocation? Frustration —
So I tried a devout education.
I've a brand new D.D.
(A religion degree),
And I'm loving my pastorization.

Recreational fishing's my sport,
And a policy gets my support.
It's called catch and release.
They're tossed back.  I'm at peace —
I don't cut reeled-in fishies' lives short.

Since my three-score-and-ten years have ended,
My expiry date's just been amended,
Renewable yearly;
Don't want to die early.
My life-span's, I hope, long extended.

Beatnik Maynard G. Krebs had a quirk:
Ergophobia (labor he'd shirk).
Every time that he heard
The feared "W-word",
He would blurt out, knee-jerkingly: "WORK!!"

All those blonde jokes I think are just mean.
Light-haired women can still be quite keen.
 For example, take me:
 I just bought a degree,
And I know four times three makes thirteen.

Define angle as "outwit a trout
In whose stream you are wading about."
Izaak Walton's Compleat
Angler's truly a treat
Of authority piscine devout.

The dowagerism of Mary—
Rich widow of Herbert, then Harry—
Commands our respect,
And you'd be quite correct
If you found the old broad a bit scary.

Fake news sites proliferate lies;
In the face of the truth their crap flies.
Many people believe them;
These sites, though, deceive them:
The pope didn't back Trump. Big surprise!

Press these driver ant heads 'cross your cut;
They'll clamp on — now you're sure I'm a nut.
Pulled apart, now, dispatched,
With their heads left attached,
As with sutures, they'll keep your wound shut.

It's not a slick riverboat card shark.
It's not a tall tree with a hard bark.
It's an African mammal,
Not warthog nor camel,
That beast that is known as the aardvark.

Savvy spin doctors make a tale tall.
Any loss is no trouble at all:
"It's an incomplete win!"
That's the art of the spin!
Breezy bafflegab cushions a fall.

Was Andromeda really that cute?
Did poor Perseus rue his pursuit?
Till the stars fade and die,
With his in-laws he'll lie,
And the horse he flew in on, to boot.

Roger Redbeard was truly obsessed —
All that treasure was leaving him stressed.
"They can kiss my patootie;
They'll not touch my booty.
It's locked in my strongbox, this chest."

Now ya can't let old Fido here scare ya;
He's ornery — I'd best prepare ya.
He's cold, needs your jacket;
Come close — he'll attack it;
It's dogskin — I double dog dare ya.

The tactics a general uses
To counter an enemy's ruses
Are likely to fail
If they merely entail
The irrational blowing of fuses.

Joseph Fraunhofer kept innovating,
And thus found a new way of creating
A spectrum, by placing
Scored lines with close spacing,
Producing diffraction by grating.

At St Andrews, my weary old caddy
Downed my bag, lit a fag, and sighed, "Laddie,
When you drive, is your goal
To avoid every hole?"
Though he'd tees, he'd no sympathy, had he?

The dastardly villain's portrayed
Wildly wielding his excurvate blade,
Its edge cleaving the air.
But the good guy won't scare—
He's not there to be diced and filleted.

Jeanie screamed, "My best brooch has been took!
Was it you, son? You're just a wee crook!"
But the gallus wee Burnie
Just answered, "Amurnie!
But gie us ten notes, an' ah'll look."

The Conservative Party won't win
An election until they begin
Making pledges so sloppy
For Labour to copy
It might make us vote them back in.

Your "Human Fly" costume's athletic,
But, frankly, those boots are pathetic.
If you want some with power
To climb Blackpool Tower,
Try mine—they're electromagnetic.

"The cultural content is sparse,"
Wrote the critic. "It lacks any class.
The play's set in a school
Where kids break every rule —
Quite ridiculous. Rather a farce."

With your charm and your guile, you excite
Pent-up lust, and my passions ignite.
If you dampen my ardour,
You'll likely retard a
Potential conception tonight.

I'll dispute stupid things now and then,
But my pal understands, counts to ten.
So please ship me down south,
Stuff a sock in my mouth,
If I bring up his girlfriend again.

An epiphyte grows on a fern,
So for nutrients oddly will turn
To the air all around,
Not the earth or the ground.
So this air plant's a growing concern.

There are sources of flavor cooks prize
In the brown bits of onion that fries;
In potatoes chefs heat,
Crispy crumbs that taste sweet —
Comes from sugars that caramelize!

The waterscape, ebbing and swelling —
Mesmeric, engrossing, dispelling
All thoughts from your mind
As your daydreams unwind —
Is hypnotic, alluring, compelling.

Said Clouseau to Kato, "It's plain,
This river we're in is in Spain."
Said Clouseau's apprentice,
"You're non compos mentis;
It's obvious, sir, you're in Seine."

My kidney's infected. Docs say,
"BK virus has made it that way."
Gosh, did I come a-cropper
By eating that Whopper?
Polyoma's what ails me today.

Call me jittery, restive, uptight:
I garage my old Buick each night,
Put her gently to bed
In her welcoming shed.
She's unwed; guess I've spoiled her a mite.

On ya new Malvern Star, wotcha think?
Down the street, to the shop for a drink.
It'll look really deadly,
Us two on ya treadly.
C'arn mate, 'ava go, gi's a dink!

Norman Bates had a mother (he thought)
Who didn't behave as she ought.
"Need a shower?" said Norm.
"Go ahead—water's warm!"
But his manner seemed strangely distraught.

My fine cock-a-doodle (that be my cock)
I'm so proud of, to everyone's shock,
I take out to display
At least once every day
On a leash as I walk round the block.

There once was a gal from La Porte,
Long before there was push-up or sport,
Who said, "I'm not vain,
But bras are too plain:
My bandeaux give my girls some support."

In post-Ottoman Cairo, the clerk
Conscientiously wears, when at work,
Three-piece suit, tie and fez
(Or tarboosh, as he says):
Full colonial garb à la Turque.

It's aculeolate (something that's prickly),
Not sagging, or sad, and not sickly.
Each tiny point sticks
Out, and each of them pricks;
On the stem it is covered quite thickly.

There is something attacking my ear—
It's so loud that I almost can't hear!
Though the buzz and the ring
Are drowned out when I sing,
Tinnitus makes hearing unclear.

If you cheat in a rowing regatta
On the silvery Río de Plata
The Argentine team
Will protest and scream,
"Declare him persona non grata!"

I decided to find a new man.
Bush league baseball was part of my plan.
At the game I met Paul
When we chased a foul ball—
Meeting fellas is catch-as-catch-can.

Potters A, B and C can't agree.
Says Miss B: "I'm a ceramist, me."
"It's ceramist," says A,
"But then Mr C's way
Is ceramicist."  Now do you see?

I love pineapples! Man, just can't kick 'em!
I'll break hundreds each day and then stick 'em
In boxes so you
Can have pineapples too.
(That expression just means that I pick 'em.)

Though emerald glories enshrined it,
The truth, when exposed, undermined it
In toto—for certain;
Since, drawing the curtain,
A wrinkled old man was behind it.

I hear "We are the world" so darn much
That my brain is beginning to clutch.
When I wish to convey
My convictions, I'll say
"I am God", "I am Scrooge", or some such.

With new leaders, reporters obsess
On the first hundred days.  An address
FDR made referred
To the Congress, no word
On the president's scope of success.

Where we're bound we've already been shown;
All determinative factors are known.
I've no doubt or illusion:
Death's a foregone conclusion.
And yet… it's not written in stone.

You're terse: sometimes brusque, sometimes blunt.
You don't waffle. You rarely confront
Any issue digressing
From what you're addressing.
But conciseness does not mean a grunt!

1 x 4, there the answer is four.
2 x 4, there the answer's four more.
3 and 4 times are plenty.
5 x 4 comes to twenty.
6 x 4 um, I'm really not sure!

From a gas well, one element's rare:
Mine gives helium — lighter than air,
And for blimps an expense
That just makes lots of sense
Because hydrogen comes with a scare.

Some curers cure things, not the masses,
And these things come in various classes:
There's tobacco and fish
Or some ham if you wish,
Though the process is slow as molasses.

An adventurer's a brave man and bold,
Of whom stirring stories are told.
But an adventuress,
Well that's rather less —
For she's only after his gold.

The doc saw the blood levels: "Wow!
We will chelate the lead, and here's how:
You'll get drugs by IV
To combine with and free
The Pb from your system — right now."

Your apelike behavior is rude,
Your conduct is frequently lewd.
But I shouldn't compare
You with apes—that's not fair.
They're honest and loyal—you're crude.

An Italian went to New York,
Where he lived upon nothing but pork.
For home he was pining:
With Roman cross-tining,
Spaghetti don't slip off your fork.

When I go to the bathroom, that's where
I might shave, brush my teeth, wash my hair.
An American, though,
When he really must "go",
Has more intimate jobs to do there.

My weight has experienced gains,
And the girdle no longer constrains
My abdominous thrust,
So I'll have to adjust
My bay window—and add a few panes.

He was thought the most punctual of men—
He would clock in at noon, out at ten.
Ten hours he "worked",
But really, he shirked.
Now he's seeking employment again.

A digraph: of letters, a pair
That depict just one sound. These I'll share:
The ai that's in fail,
Or sh as in shale
Are digraphic like ch in chair.

No dishonor's deserved, no disgrace
In that tenderness worn on your face.
Too many are burned
By a love unreturned,
Though in this instance, that's not the case.

When there's stuff that you plan getting hawked
And strong sales that you wish being chalked...
If it's bait that you need,
Here's what's hard not to heed—
Those smooth booth babes, spot-lit, getting gawked.

Not a braggart, I'm never a boaster;
Still my face graces Ride-a-Way's poster,
'Cause the size of my grin
Is as wide as the spin
From the hills and the loops of their coaster.

Discontinuous poems are(n't) here.
They begin, then break off — reappear
So fitful, sporadic;
Or wand'ring, nomadic;
Once started they'll finish some year.

Jack's an active, dynamical guy —
Has of ergs an abnormal supply.
He does all things with vigor,
Though some people snigger,
"Too fast on the trigger!" Not I.

If I eat wilted endive, I sigh.
When I hear soulful music, I cry.
Whether eating bad salads
Or hearing sad ballads,
I'm depressed, and I just want to die.

There are billboard-like signs sometimes seen
In our neighborhood schools. What's this mean?
Stop corporate vandalism,
Referred to as brandalism!
We must keep school hallways pristine!

Watch the audience struggle to gauge
The jihadist comedian's rage.
Is their dogged applause
In support of his cause,
Or to keep him from bombing on stage?

We were out in the park on a jog
When we heard something bark like a dog.
"There are dogs in this park?"
"Weren't no dog made that bark;
That's a barking deer, down by the bog."

Fred took pence to the bank in his town.
But the bank didn't care, turned him down.
The cashier shook her head,
And, disinterested, said,
"On such wee p. accounts we banks frown."

A football player — that's what we call
A big bruiser who's giving his all,
And he's running around
With his team on the ground
With a prolate spheroidal-shaped ball.

When there's grit in the eye (so you cry),
Or the lacrimal gland goes awry,
And your eyes are all wet
(Though you're not that upset),
Sounds like dacryops: wetness of eye.

It's a job-for-life promise. You're hired!
Glad it matches to what you aspired.
Guaranteed? But of course!
And it's always in force
(Till our get-out clause trips. Then you're fired).

Out in Northam, a suburb of Perth,
Ed will never know hunger or dearth,
For a fortune he's made
In the creamery trade,
And he milks it for all that it's worth.

Do your new denim jeans leave you cold?
Way too blue? Nearly too stiff to fold?
Acid washed when they're made,
Will both soften and fade;
Now your new jeans can look just like old!

Said a mason, face down in his mastic,
"Some measures I'll take that are drastic,
As this fast drying grout
Has done ate up my snout.
I will get me a surgeon that's plastic."

The hand that Bill Hickok had held
Became legend when Jack McCall yelled,
"Take that!" — shot him dead
In the back of the head.
Before others could fold, Bill was felled.

Bohemianism's intention
Is to live unrestrained by convention
With a privileged few
And create something new—
But just what?  That's too touchy to mention!

Your base salary? Twenty-four grand.
But not all in one go, understand?
Every month we will pay
You two thousand, okay?
(Plus a bonus per sale you can land.)

On those oldies but goodies I'm sold.
I delight in that true solid gold.
I get simply delirious
Listening to Sirius
Radio's decades of old.

From a lender I borrowed a grand
In a loan I must pay on demand.
If it's called, I'll be hauled
Into court and forestalled
From repainting my hamburger stand.

A cave dweller's living next door
In my skyscraper's 43rd floor.
Since he doesn't come out
Very often, I doubt
That he's noticed it's summer no more.

For my friend and philosopher Betty,
Cosmogonic reflection's not petty.
It's important to see
How the world came to be:
'Twas a monster (who flies) of spaghetti!

"Mister Chairman—" I said: what a flub!
Our chairperson's a "dame", not a "bub"!
It turns out (just as well)
I was right (you can't tell
In the Crying Game Film Lovers' Club).

I eschew all established beliefs;
I've got stockpiles of grumbles and beefs.
Never charge me to choose;
Why need either side lose?
I'm commando—not boxers or briefs.

What's plaguing my pet looks bubonic,
So the vet mixed my tomcat a tonic.
But I fear a mistake
Since the cat's wide awake,
But immobile and stiff—how ironic!

If you blooded the seat with your butt,
Then you stained it with blood from your cut.
 But a full-blooded setter
 Is purebred, much better
Than any old mongrel or mutt.

Fine furniture is, as a rule,
Made by hand with a carpenter's tool.
When it's inlaid with shell,
And with metal as well,
We refer to the inlay as boulle.

Place the ball in the quarterback's lap
Then prepare to move out, block the gap.
Guards and tackles, dismayed
That he's handsomely paid,
Say, "What? Centering?  That's just a snap."

"It's not easy, it's hard, but we'll go
To the moon really soon — make it so!"
Enantiosis (the pairing
Of contrasts so glaring)
Adds force, as the words above show.

Only people or dogs, but not beavers
Get sick with canicola fevers.
This dire diagnosis
Of leptospirosis
Makes atheists into believers.

Here's a torrent file. Download; enjoy.
Use a BitTorrent client. Employ
All your peers, who will share
Bits of files here and there.
They're retrieved and assembled. Oh, boy!

My problems I long to unload:
The critics' opinions erode
My self-confidence, eat at
My pride. My defeat at
Their hands makes me want to explode.

If a surface is shiny and bright,
It is glossy, reflective of light:
Like a healthy dog's hair,
Wood that's polished with care,
Or a Mylar balloon taking flight.

My college just built a new dorm.
Seems it's cubo-octahedral in form,
Like a cube that's been cut
At each corner, somewhat.
Dean McNutt said, "That shape's the new norm!"

All gamblers aspire to win pots
In casinos—they take their best shots,
And on sports they bet too.
Is this anything new?
In the Bible, we read, they cast lots!

In a thunderstorm, dear Uncle Bart
Was struck down playing "How Great Thou Art"
For good cheer, far from home,
On his new metal comb —
An ironical way to depart.

In manège, riders shorten the stride
Of their mounts and change gaits as they ride.
When collected, a horse
Is dynamic, of course,
And a source of equestrian pride.

I have eaten the meal of my dreams.
Such cuisine, taken to the extremes,
Made a glutton of me
And I do guarantee
That I surely will burst at the seams.

I once was so hammered on gin
That I slept with my wife's sexy twin.
But I figure, since they
Share the same DNA,
Biologically, where is the sin?

Breaking rules, as when nations engage
In adventurism on the world stage,
Often leads to disaster,
Both small-scale and vaster;
It sends me right into a rage.

You've a girlfriend you've known since your teens,
But a robot may lurk in her genes.
If you two were a match
Would automata hatch?
(They are people who act like machines.)

Susie's runs were nonstop, and a drench
Didn't work. Then Miguel flushed a wrench
And a lightbulb to see
What would happen. Poo-ee!
The whole house had a feculent stench.

When I took on a cowhand, the battle
Was correcting his oddly phrased prattle.
I've been trying to teach
Him our Western-style speech.
He says "beeves"—that's his way to say cattle.

We drank wine, a divine Spanish red,
And on pheasant most pleasant we fed,
'Til I bit on a pellet
Of birdshot.  Oh hell, it
Has crushed my bicuspid with lead!

Tea for one: surely nothing is easier?
Re-boil water you've twice left to freeze, yeah?
Pour on bag; leave to stew.
Nuke; forget; re-nuke too.
(Yes, I suffer from beverage amnesia.)

Young Montague Smithers felt slighted:
"Without title or rank, life is blighted.
On my yacht in the Med
I take maidens to bed
Every evening. I should be first-knighted."

It's the time-hardened urine of rats,
Found in caves sometimes lived in by bats.
Called amberat, it's
Used in binding the bits
Of a midden, the home of their brats.

On a clothesline your linens will dry,
Using wind and the sun in the sky.
It's the natural way,
The ecologists say.
Peg your laundry — please give it a try.

Jersey's Gotham is Batman's home city,
Depicted as crime-ridden, gritty,
With villains arcane
And quite often insane.
If you live there, my god, you've my pity!

As per usual, I'm running late.
It's my typical, natural state.
It's my regular way
To arrive with delay
For a party, my job, or a date.

It's okay to affect airs and graces.
It's okay to strike deep, knowing faces.
But your studied façade
Comes across kind of odd
'Cuz you're still just a cute kid with braces.

If a crapehanger darkens the room
With an attitude driven by gloom,
The good news that you savor
To him seems much graver,
And portentously signals your doom.

With the end zone in sight, Leon Lett
(Who's as dumb as a Cowboy could get)
Saw himself on TV
And he thought, "Hey, that's me!"
The Bills' Beebe said, "You ain't scored yet!"

The pole-sitter, coping with stress,
Took the high road and met with success.
All his apical sitting
Was better than flitting
Around, ever under duress.

Feather beds can seem soft and sublime
When they're new — like stuffed pillows; but I'm
Rather reckoning that
They will feel hard and flat
As the feathers compress over time.

The communally owned village square
Is a nice piece of property, where
A developer, Paul,
Wants to build a new mall.
We refuse. It's a view we all share.

Grand climacteric? That is the year
That I'm age 63, so I hear.
The term's also a date
I will have to await,
Though its purpose is wholly unclear.

Czechoslovakia's no more intact:
Into two parts the nation was cracked.
Czech Republic does great —
Czechvar beer is first-rate!
Pilsner Urquell is too — that's a fact.

A gourmet from L.A. who's called Ian
Digs the food from the blue Caribbean.
Much better than Libyan,
He savors Caribbean—
And he likes it much more than Korean.

The new system's divisible. Please
Watch me sunder each segment—with ease.
Decompoundable gear
Is high-tech's new frontier:
Frequent upgrades, you'll find, are a breeze.

You went to a haute cuisine smorgy
And unwittingly scarfed up a corgi.
It's a dog-eat-dog world,
But alas, you still hurled,
And today you were hauled to the morgue-y.

A bassoonist makes sounds low and mellow.
His range is like that of the cello.
His solos are soulful,
Most pensive and doleful,
He must be a very sad fellow.

If you find your old rug is possessed
By some rug-eating bugs and their nest,
You should call up a firm
Who will come and exterm-
inate vermin. What's best? Disinfest.

Your  behavior is quite apathetic!
Though you've said you were peripatetic,
You just sit like a lump,
You don't run, you don't jump...
Are you clinically stuck—akinetic?

Good luck if you try to tell jokes
To some agelasts (humorless folks).
They are all out of whack
With a levity lack.
Not one crack of a smile will you coax.

Don't dismiss this as some sort of fluke.
You deserve my severest rebuke.
Why disparage an Asian
Of any persuasion?
I'm appalled that you called me a gook.

"Hey, pardon me, boy, but what's down
This here line?" "Why, a place of renown!
It's the Tennessee hub
Of our train network, bub:
Chattanooga, the choo-choo-based town."

The first in the count would be aen;
Number two (mostly white) becomes taen.
Carry on, but don't sleep—
It's the way to count sheep
On the land of the Dales-country man.

It seems Jacob's again in a pout—
He has lost all his humorous clout.
He can verbally jab
And sarcastically stab,
But can't take what he's quick to dish out.

CH, if you're in the UK,
Means "Companion of Honour," they say.
It's bestowed by the Queen,
So its opposite's seen
As FWP (USA).

Aclarubicin, when it is used,
Leaves leukemia patients enthused.
When you're choosing, be smart;
It won't damage your heart.
Other medicines should be refused.

The aft is the rear of this plane,
Where two airline attendants remain
For the takeoff and landing—
And where I'll be standing
When sitting starts causing me pain.

It's an obsolete, dialect word,
So now fidge is today seldom heard.
Of a limb it's to twitch,
Of a body to itch,
So its pitch keeps you restlessly stirred.

Your favour to hand, of 6th ult.,
And oblige, as per same, pro result,
We assure best attention
In receipt of which mention,
This old business letter's occult.

Mom kept struggling to bring out the best in him,
But she never could settle the pest in him.
He'd go raging about
Then call, "Mom, bail me out."
Now it's murder. There's one last arrest in him.

During summertime's blue skies and sun,
There's a Hebrew month lacking in fun.
It's not one that I love
'Cause the first part of Av
Means that meat, mirth and music we shun.

For brothers, we sometimes say brethren,
Yet more than one mother's not "methren".
This irregular form
Is so far from the norm,
It's a plural unlike any ethren.

When Baggins escaped from the jail,
With Beauregard hot on his tail,
The hobbit, to kill Beau,
Drew Sting, his new bilbo,
Which sundered poor Beauregard's mail.

There once was an old man named Katz [hackneyed]
Ol' man Katz Quinn domiciliates cats, ["Katz/cats" redundant / doesn't mean anything]
And the neighbors all think that he's bats. [no def here]
With the stink and the fights,
He keeps neighbors up nigths. [sounds like Quinn stinks]
He's been evicted from seventeen flats. [starts w 3 USs]
[Expect grief from editors ref use of "flats" (unnatural for Yank writer) / simple answer: I'm American but Quinn is British]

The fossils of Tubulidentata
Are found in Cretaceous substrata.
The aardvark, resplendent
Sole living descendant,
Provides us with much-needed data.

Turn a smile to a frown? Here's the way.
'Just say cheese'? No, instead, you can say
To the snapper, 'Gruyere'
(Cheese with holes everywhere)
From whole milk made—hard, flat (tastes okay).

Your amygdalae always remain
On alert, deep inside of your brain.
They light up with each treat—
Drugs you take, food you eat—
But react to both pleasure and pain.

When you want to explain an abstraction,
And you do it by using real action,
Symbolism's the game.
Allegory's the name.
And the reader gets true satisfaction.

At our hoedown, the mood is bucolic:
Just a farmer's no-frills fun and frolic.
We've got ginger ale here
And, as well, ginger beer.
Rest assured neither one's alcoholic.

In two seconds, a setting's erased.
With a clock wipe, the scene is replaced:
Second hand sweeps around
And the film's on new ground—
Gives a place change an odd, vintage taste.

Every season, with burgeoning zest,
Offers gifts, though for me far the best
Is when leaves by degrees
From deciduous trees
In a breeze leave the trees all undressed.

"Will it play in Peoria?" was,
In the past, often asked to mean "Does
It have mainstream appeal?
Take their pulse, get a feel,
And we hope it sparks positive buzz."

I showed this technique to young Vince
Using papers of various tints:
Fold the four corners in
To the centre — begin!
Origamists call that move a blintz.

Antiperspirants gum up your glands —
So your sweat doesn't drip down your hands
From your "pits of despair"
To the pile, filed with care,
Labelled "Parking fines: final demands".

Pick your socks off the floor, messy guys.
When you pee, close the door — spare my eyes!
It's not just a wife
Who trains men in this life.
(A domesticator's word to the wise.)

Her erratical takes? Disconcerting.
She often would laugh at my flirting,
But sometimes act sad,
And might even get mad;
Her moods were forever inverting.

Though a cow has two horns to admire,
It's her longer term outlook that's dire.
She is milked twice a day
With no pay except hay,
And no savings on which to retire.

When the missile went wobbly, we ducked,
And I ordered: "Proceed with destruct!
Don't just sit there, you dunce —
Push the button at once!
If it falls on our heads, we'll be — out of lucked!"

Define dureless? Ephemeral, fleeting,
Like diets I try; I'm retreating
Before I begin.
I won't ever be thin,
'Cause I'm just too addicted to eating.

A Norseman of stature and fame
Needed someone to keep high the flame.
So he named his son heir,
As he cried, "Leif the Fair,
You're my arfname—I hereby proclaim."

The glaciers knew all of the tricks.
Those ice sheets, for giggles and kicks,
Gave the earth a refacing,
While clearly outpacing
The traffic on I-66.

"Kate in billing (blonde, blue-eyed and stacked)
Is now packing her things; she's been sacked."
"That's just rumor! You know
Gals like her aren't let go."
"Yes, they are, AAMOF."

"Dear John," the brief letter began.
"I'm in love with a wonderful man.
While I know you're at war,
Please, my dear, don't be sore.
I love him and not you. Your ex, Dan."

My doctor said, "Granny, my dear,
Your results have returned and it's clear
Why your hearing's amiss—
Leaking endolymph!  This
Is a fluid contained in your rear."

Configurable systems escape
The restriction of pre-ordained shape
Or condition: a dimmer
Turns glare into glimmer;
A stole may unfold to a cape.

Just the size of a freckle, but (ick!)
No one likes his blood sucked by a tick.
And the deer tick, we find,
Can be doubly unkind
If its Lyme disease germs make you sick.

In this aerial gunnery range
I go hiking. Some say that I'm strange
As I stroll here admiring
Planes bombing and firing,
Uncaring I might be in dange—

"I am brooding about Joanne Dru,"
Sighed Fitzhugh. Sue replied, "Joanne who?"
"She was quite often seen
On the large and small screen,
And made westerns—it's true—quite a few."

For motion away from your middle,
Abductor's the muscle you'll twiddle.
Once done with its task,
Might the muscle then ask
For a ransom?  Perhaps — it's a riddle.

A blacksmith who worked in Alsace
Produced breastplates and backplates en masse.
Some complained that his rig
Made their bums look too big.
He'd reply, "You've just got a cuirass!"

Gig economy jobs like I've got
Are a real anti-working man plot.
See, my cab driver neighbor
Gets paid for his labor,
Plus benefits! Me? I do not.

Getting older, I curse at the ways
That the calendar tricks and betrays.
It's completely infernal
That weeks seem eternal
While years pass more quickly than days.

Are mosquitos disturbing your nap?
What you need is a blacklight-type trap.
Using light that bugs see
(Though it looks black to me),
It lures insects inside, and then—zap!

Though their colors and size may attract us,
Promulgation's uncertain in practice.
Pollen's spread by a bat,
And that's how it's begat:
Bright red dragon fruit, spawned by a cactus.

As the sun sets I wait for the sounds
Of the horses that pass through the grounds:
The steady clop-clopping
Of heavy hooves dropping
On flagstones. It always astounds.

If you see that four sixths is two thirds,
Then cross-multiply, do it in words:
Six times two, four times three;
They're both twelve, you'll agree.
You all get it?  You're certified nerds.

The coif didn't rate admiration —
Instead, it caused great consternation.
Either she is a he,
Or it's he that's a she,
But that butch cut made quite a sensation.

My life's a Copernican one.
I don't plan it; my wife sees it done.
I just moon (and look odd)
Round her heavenly bod,
While we both run in rings round our son.

It's the '50s, and everyone strives
To have boring, identical lives
In the 'burbs with one's spouse,
In a cookie-cutter house,
Being judged by the Chevy one drives.

From their early days (rhythm and blues)
As The Robins, their songs would amuse.
As The Coasters, they found
More fame clowning around.
Later groups with that name would confuse.

My dear granny is ancient and gray —
A great programmer, though, I must say.
In the morning she knits
And the Scotch whiskey hits,
But does coding the rest of the day.

It may seem amusing and neat
To tackle this challenging feat
In extra-fast times,
But with this many rhymes,
Whatever we do, they'll accrete.

It was John C. Calhoun, R.I.P.,
As a U.S. V.P. from S.C.,
Who said, "Laws we create
Can be nixed by each state,
So I'm keeping my slaves. Q.E.D."

His OCD's really quite vicious:
To satisfy germ-killing wishes,
When he's prepping to eat,
Using pressure and heat,
He first autoclaves all of his dishes.

I won't dress up in any old rag,
I wear heels, and I carry a bag—
But you see, I'm a guy,
So you might say that I
Have a high coefficient of drag.

An academic's a man whose I.Q.
Far surpasses all but for a few.
But should great intellect
Engender respect
In a man who can't tie his own shoe?

Emigration can be a decision
Which doesn't allow for revision.
Leave your country behind?
You don't know what you'll find!
It may even end up in derision.

There's Thaddea, dear Vesper's mom,
At a Paris café, très bon,
When soup took a spill
Down her dress (what a thrill!)
And her elegant meal went quite wrong!

Let's consider the facts, arguendo.
These charges are just innuendo.
This poor detainee
Should surely go free.
(I'm reaching a fervent crescendo.)

Louie sneered and then spat with disgust:
"A bust in the mouth, I would trust,
You don't want." I replied,
Just a little bit snide,
"That depends, I suppose, on the bust."

Eastern bluebirds would seem to deem best
A clean birdhouse to use for their nest
(If mind reading's correct
In this birdbrain respect),
But not placed (in the States) too far west.

Now if I were condemned to swing high,
Then, the last night before I would die,
I might choose my last meal;
I'd say, "Frankly, I feel
Like mashed spud atop mince: cottage pie!"

Our new neighbor will lie in the raw
As she sunbathes.  She hasn't a flaw.
What a sight!  I affix
Both my eyes on that chick's
Altogether, completely in awe.

Do have some madeira, m'dear,
And don't be afraid to come near.
I see that you're yawning—
Perhaps by the morning
My beard could be tickling your ear.

Princess Margaret once had a beau,
But alas could she marry him? No.
Maggie's man was divorced
So that poor "bird" was forced
To fly off feeling sorrow and woe.

Grandma Nasty was totally sure:
"Every child needs a spanking du jour!"
I once crayoned a scrawl
On her living room wall.
She was clearly no art connoisseur.

Though disquieted's seldom expressed,
It's an adjective used to suggest
An uneasy affliction,
Be it real or fiction —
So lay off me; I'm anxious and stressed.

Have a facial: it's never too late
To improve on what's given by fate.
Once the skin of the face
Has been pampered with grace,
You'll be glowing, and look and feel great.

I'd invited some friends to my do,
But a gatecrasher came along, too.
His quick wit had us rocking
With laughter — so shocking
From somebody nobody knew!

This teen's battery's low. This might hurt her.
Quick, please locate an outlet. Insert her
Phone's charger, and see,
She's now painless and free,
And it's thanks to this flyback converter.

Her performance? A sight to behold!
She impressed seven judges all told.
Perfect style, total grace,
A sure thing for first place—
She was rightly awarded the gold.

Robert Burchfield, that lexical pope,
Made catholic the OED's scope:
To non-British use willing
To give equal billing —
His revision of Fowler? No soap.

With the very first flash in the pan,
I was hooked and the arson began.
All the blazes were small
Till I torched city hall,
And the cops threw my arse in the can.

Once "A dolt!" or "A dunce!" you could say
Of a fool, but not now, not today.
So to ID a kind
Of subminiature mind,
Do you morons think birdbrain's okay?

In the window the calico lies;
She's the cat with the clear amber eyes.
She responds with a purr
As I stroke her warm fur,
Her harlequin patchwork disguise.

Where was soup spilled on Zypher's mom?
