This is a test to see how well you are paying attention. This text is a series of limericks. At the end of the list of limericks, there will be a question. The question will be about one of the limericks. Please answer the question as concisely as possible.



I promise to you I'll bequeath,
From the heavens to Earth underneath,
The lighthearted glow
Of folks in the know
And a full set of thirty-two teeth.

"Farewell!" he exclaimed, "And goodbye.
I'm so sad to be leaving. Don't cry.
How I'll miss your long legs,
And your bacon and eggs.
I shall picture you each time I fry."

To my home-brew I've added some bentonite
As the party is starting at ten tonight.
If the brew doesn't clear,
Then I very much fear
That we'll have to drink pub beer again tonight.

Two Native American leaders
Are familiar to history readers:
One a Blackfoot chief who
Preferred peace; one a Sioux,
Both the Crowfoots would not be succeeders.

I'm de-energized—lost my ambition.
It's a listless, exhausted condition.
Once a fireball, a force,
Now I'm just a dead horse,
Like a car with a switched-off ignition.

At the rates barbers charge, I have soured.
Fifty bucks? No damn way! I'm empowered
To take on their roll
With my scissors and bowl.
So who cares if I look like Moe Howard!?

Forty dancers stand poised on the stage.
The director had hoped to engage
Seven girls from this pack;
But this cattle call's lack
Of raw talent has him in a rage.

Casus belli means "reason for war."
We have justification galore:
They have weapons (or will)
That can injure or kill!
Let's attack them and even the score.

This place on my front you caressed
That resides between navel and breast:
Epigastrial area.
Hands off — how dare ya!
Buddy, you're under arrest.

If you listen to us you'll be saved!
Join our faith and become well behaved.
Then you'll find when you pray,
As we gospellers say,
That your pathway to heaven's been paved.

A small boy named Zypher in Spain,
Had ice cream on beach terrain,
When a bold seagull swooped,
And his cone was then scooped,
Leaving poor Zypher crying in vain!

North of Dublin, the monks left their cells,
Transcribing, their days ruled by bells.
The great treasure produced
In their stone-built old roost:
The sublimely adorned Book of Kells.

You aquaplaners must be insane
To love sport that requires no brain.
Duh. Get towed by a boat
On a board that can float—
What?  You're kidding.  You're licenced to train?

The trees blazed; the flames flared and got higher.
His home then ignited, caught fire.
It brought tears to his eyes,
Which is not a surprise;
He'd just found, after months, a cash buyer.

The august Court of Sewers decreed
That the almanac man filled a need.
His job? He provides
Any news of high tides
That could lead to bad times guaranteed.

When in summer they come from their caves
To our beaches to savour the waves,
The surfers and shaggies
Clad only in baggies
Go battle the ocean like braves.

You're so stoic, when I would despair. It
Astounds me. I'd crumble, I swear it.
First the lockjaw you got,
Then an unwanted tot—
It's a lot, but you just grin and bear it!

They think the old pit has been mined
To exhaustion, but one day they find
A new face to be cleaved.
Every miner's relieved
That they're finally out of that bind.

In all of these photos, my honey
Is gesturing ears of a bunny
Behind me.  This prank
Is so old.  Let's be frank:
Long ago it had ceased being funny.

Simple adequacy? That's a condition
With no strong plus or minus position.
If week after week
This is all that you seek,
Then it's clear that you're lacking ambition.

My daughter is ill; I can't leave her
To visit your golden retriever.
We just bought a new cat
And resulting from that,
She's in bed with the dread cat scratch fever.

As I told the museum curator,
"As a sculptor, there's nobody greater.
I'm still boasting the stone,
So just leave me alone!
It'll look like your grandmother later."

"And away we go!" Gleason would cry
As he moved 'round the stage looking spry.
With his music for traveling
He had us unraveling,
Splitting sides 'til we thought we would die.

I keep cinnabar moths out in back.
Callimorpha are large, red, and black.
They lay eggs in large batches,
And when the brood hatches,
On leaves of the ragwort they snack.

When he speaks, he makes furniture care;
He awakens with drama and flare.
It's an aura he weaves:
We believe he believes.
He electrifies everyone there.

The flatboat that drifted along
Is now empty. But worthless? That's wrong —
I bought it as barge board.
Each piece is a large board.
I'll build a house sturdy and strong.

AA? It depends how one feels.
If your car should break down, lose its wheels,
And you wait for assistance —
Just boost your resistance.
Take cocktails, but only with meals.

Have some green insect protein for lunch.
Roasted termites give salsa some crunch,
Or just add cricket flour
To dough for more power.
Entomophagy: Insects? We'll munch.

Antacids are made out of chalk,
And they help if your stomach should balk
At any suggestion
Of normal digestion
(Though they'll cause you to belch when you talk).

I've a tree in my yard in a plight;
All its leaves are diseased — it's a sight.
And the skin of that tree
Peels to such a degree
That its bark is much worse than its blight.

Disingenuous comments she'll make
Mean I trust her as much as a snake.
Like assault and then battery,
She charms, seeming chattery;
It's flattery—faker than fake.

"Son, top brass are the echelons (upper),
In the officers' mess, scoffing supper."
"And their squadrons of planes,
Like grey geese strung in skeins,
Fly in echelons (Vees), don't they, papa?"

My friend's casual approach seems to spring
From his carelessness, often to bring
Him considerable grief
With no end or relief:
Yes, of recklessness, he is the king.

Zimbabwe? I still say Rhodesia.
Antacid? That's Milk of Magnesia.
Ask me anything new
And I won't have a clue—
Could it be I've developed dysmnesia?

"Simple" Murphy, that ding-dong, sneered, "Right!
A bell's peal is a ding-dong? Not quite!
I've heard that one before
From your mother, the whore,"
So we had us a wild, ding-dong fight.

As it's processed, take care not to spoil it.
It's helpful to add to the soil; it
Is called biosolid.
Its origin's squalid:
The stuff that we flush down the toilet.

My accountant is acting contrite.
Though he's sworn that his bookkeeping's right,
He's afraid of an audit
That might dig up fraud. It
Is awesome, what's coming to light!

Milking cows was an everyday act
That the milkmaids performed with great tact,
But they sometimes got cowpox
(Those itchy-and-how pox),
Though smallpox they didn't contract.

When your robot has motion bionic,
If it moves to the grooves that are sonic,
Then it has a nice name
(A bit long, all the same).
It's called audio-animatronic.

Lots of foodstuffs when eaten are scary;
Some are spicy or acrid or hairy.
But a red fruit that's yummy,
And feels good in your tummy,
Is the juicy, delicious bing cherry.

Bought a face cord of firewood to burn
'Neath my still.  I am fixing to turn
Some corn mash into 'shine,
Which I'll sell down the line.
It's amazing how much I can earn.

Bert was hurt in last Thursday's insurgency.
We transported the victim with urgency
To the casualty ward.
No, he wasn't ignored
By the ward that is labelled emergency.

If a turbulent flight makes you gag,
Flight attendants might give you this tag:
You're an "airsickness guy."
They'd prefer you not fly,
But at least they provide you a bag.

While for kids (to the age of, say, nine)
Numbered dot-to-dot puzzles are fine,
I think grown-ups are clots
To form pictures from dots;
In fact, that's where I must draw the line.

A breakout recording's a smash
From an artist whose past work was trash,
Or perhaps wasn't played
By the deejays who trade
In payola—big bundles of cash.

When you don't have a fever or chills
Or a cough as a sign of your ills,
You are asymptomatic.
It's not so dramatic.
You're not looking green 'round the gills.

When the moon wears an ice-crystal shroud,
You will miss, if you walk with head bowed,
The astonishing sight
Of a halo of light.
And the cause? Cirrostratus, the cloud.

For the rest of my lifetime I will
Recollect that most bone-chilling trill
That my dentist produces
With his tool of all uses—
His bought-from-Goodwill dentist's drill.

I believe it's incredibly silly
To use overblown words willy-nilly.
When a phrase can be filled
With the simple word gild,
Only fools use "deaurate a lily."

When you're batting, your helmet's the gear
To protect when you're plunked in the ear
By the chin-music heat
Cause you wouldn't retreat.
This is baseball. Don't show any fear.

In a full deck of cards there's a place
For twelve court cards (the ones with a face).
In blackjack, you'll win,
So just sit, stand, and grin
If you're dealt one of these with an ace.

Here's a reader from Boston who writes:
"When I travel the South I have fights
With the lunkheads down there
Who appear not to care
That it's wrong to say 'cut out the lights'!

(Signed) Correct Northerner"

Anthroposociology's not
Only Greek, for it tells us a lot
About places on races,
And races on places —
Effects of (I almost forgot).

There once was a lawyer from Ayr,
Whose new clients, a quarrelsome pair,
Tried contesting the split.
Though the will was legit,
They still whined when they got their fair share.

There's bedlam in June in New York,
Since it's littered with tourists who gawk
Both at this and at that,
And then end up squashed flat —
The fools run when the lights say "Don't Walk!"

The King's range of movement's one square,
But just once, he's allowed a move where
He can gain a safe nook,
Leaping over a rook,
And thus castled, he's safe in his lair.

You damn cowlick!  Just how could you be
Sticking up my whole life.  Now I see
That you still are a chore
To comb flat even for
The mortician.  It's not only me.

It is true these draconian laws
Are severe on all crimes such as yours.
Your offense may be minor;
That's tough, me old china.
Your head's coming off early doors.

If you lied with intention to hide
What is true, then it's clear you denied
What you knew to be right.
Now you can't sleep at night
For the guilt that you carry inside.

My son's brainsick; he's crazy, insane,
And he gives me an' Momma a pain.
Screws are loose neath his hat;
In his belfry's a bat.
He's a nut and a nut he'll remain!

There are Native Americans who
Are Algonquin. More names? They've a few.
Try Algonkian or
There's Algonkin. One more:
How's Algonquian fit your canoe?

Every person with whom I must work
Is, beyond any question, a jerk.
No exceptions! Not Bill,
Not Loretta, not Phil,
Not Rudolfo, not Edna, not Kirk!

Said Napoleon, "Small gets sold short,
But battalion-wise thus I was taught:
When God gauges each force,
It's a matter of course
That the bigger one gets his support."

Now that nature has planted a seed,
Meg's a busy young woman, indeed.
Every room in her house
(Not to mention her blouse)
Is cram-full with what babies all need.

C.J. Strolin is famous for coinage
Of nonce he can use to adjoinage
One thought to another,
A rhyme to its brother,
Or simply for fun like kaboinage.

Assimilationists stand up and say
That all kids should speak English today:
Different tongues could bring strife,
And divide like a knife
Every you in the U. S. of A.

When at dog races greyhounds are run,
Lots of money is lost, and some won,
But a dogfight's illegal
(Whether pit bull or beagle).
It's bloody and brutal—not fun.

Hector's sick, so I must disinfect
All his clothes that I'm here to collect.
I don't care if his flu
Is N1 or N2.
That's the rule—I mean no disrespect.

At botany, Steve was the master,
Discovering flowers much faster
Than others could label;
They lay on the table,
Their interim name: adelaster.

Both his arms hang down well past his knees
And he'll offer to groom you for fleas.
While this apishness is
A prime drawback of his,
He's unequaled at climbing in trees.

Antiphonal musical folk
Found out in the time pre-Baroque
Two alternate choirs
Of singers and lyres
Can please any stereo bloke.

In light of the pounds I'd been shedding,
I produced my old tux for the wedding.
It was bindingly tight
So I gave up the fight,
Bought a new tux. My gut's resumed spreading.

You're awfully rude, a real crowder.
You push and you shove, and yell louder
Than any in line
Who are waiting to dine
On my best busking fiddler crab chowder.

Acidification is handy
(But not in the making of candy).
It stops apples from browning,
And piemen from frowning;
The tartness it adds is just dandy.

Those strange numbers and letters distorted
With all vowels and digits contorted
Are used to help spot
Whether human or bot
Tried to enter the data reported.

He's a narcissist. Ask him right now,
And he'll gladly (and how) take a bow.
He conducts his affairs
While he's putting on airs—
Cat's pajamas (like wow!), cat's meow!

"A defleeted old Ford Crown Victoria!"
Cried a man with the glow of euphoria.
"Though no longer a rental,
Her charm's elemental.
Bet she'll love it back home in Peoria."

Ferlinghetti thinks notice is neat,
And for Ginsberg, acclaim is a treat.
But Jack Kerouac's fame
Brings abashment and shame:
He's becoming, well, read as a Beat.

A father, in Rome, had a daughter,
And he loved his fair child, and he taught her
A high moral code
(From which tragedy flowed,
For it led to her innocent slaughter).

With a double entendre, life's sunny
Through a two-meaning phrase, often punny.
Skilful wordplay will whizz
Up your limericks with fizz—
And makes many indecently funny.

General purpose means 'useful for more
Than one sole application or chore'.
If called out to repair
What's unclear till you're there,
Take a tool that's got options galore.

Down in Texas, an error baptismal
By the preacher caused trouble abysmal.
With the font filled with crude,
Utter havoc ensued.
It was oil, as he claimed, but not chrismal.

Center stage, a theatrical phrase,
Is employed in more general ways:
It's a prominent place
Or position—the space
That commands our attention or praise.

Cloudy skies always fill me with dreariness.
When the sun shines my mood lifts to cheeriness.
It's not rained for two weeks;
All these smiles hurt my cheeks—
Peppy bouncing's collapsed into weariness...

The West Indies islands (I'll scrawl 'em),
Less Bahamas, Antilles we call 'em.
The Greater are four
Islands northwestern-more,
And the Lesser's the rest. Yep, it's all 'em!

There's a type of dianthus, clove pink,
Whose age is unknown. People think
It has ancient relations
With modern carnations'
Ancestral botanical link.

Some annelids (earthworms and leeches)
That crawl in the sea and on beaches
Lack organs like gills.
Oh, the wonders and thrills
You receive when a limerick teaches!

Corroboration is what it'll take
If I'm gonna be catchin' a break.
So your story is this:
Say to Mom it was sis,
And not me, you saw eating the cake.

Chicharrones are pigskins, deep-fried;
Their addictiveness can't be denied:
If you crunch some at lunch,
Bet you'll crave quite a bunch,
But your heart would say, "Push 'em aside."

Those Republican radicals knew
That to get their own president through,
'Twas no good to dig dirt:
Wave the old bloody shirt;
Extra votes would then surely ensue.

I like walnuts and hazelnuts, too,
Though Brazil nuts and almonds will do.
They're all good for me, but
One particular nut
Sets my allergies going: Cashew!

That Smithsonian stuff he despised —
Thought mementos were overly prized —
Even spurned MIT
(It's the I, don't you see?),
So he's deinstitutionalized.

Was Anthony wishing to play
When he cast all his cautions away?
Was he just adding litter,
By placing on Twitter
The worst of his Weiner display?

My chromosome's shorter? How so?
(It's the one that I share with my bro.)
Oh, Y can't I boast?
Alas, smaller than most,
My allosome's  not much to show.

When Beth comes to play in the attic,
I submit to her whims. Charismatic,
She dreams up a quest
And dictates how they dressed,
And we dress thus, for Beth's cosmocratic.

We're opponents of human malignity.
We're handling affairs with benignity.
We're helpful; just try us.
We're holy and pious.
We're models of humble condignity.

I'd say acne scrofulosorum
Is the strangest discussed in this forum.
This acne will pick
Children already sick.
How I wish that this crap would ignore 'em.

Desert boots, which to ankles extend,
Made of super-soft leather, soon bend.
Walk for miles with a smile
In a chic crepe-soled style:
An oasis of calm will descend.

The port engine's beginning to stutter;
We can feather those blades once we shut her.
That'll level the pitch
So we won't need to ditch.
The flight's smooth, on one prop, as warm butter.

An auntlike and flowery note
Came to nieces, abroad and remote.
It was writ on fine vellum
By old Auntie Bellum.
How marvelous; watch Auntie dote!

What the engine block does, in effect,
Is encompass, contain, and protect
Moving parts: odds and sods
Like the crankshaft and rods,
And the pistons—all fitted and checked.

For five years we've discussed those damn birds,
All the racket they make and their turds.
Maybe now we'll have peace.
I just shot thirty geese.
Clearly actions speak louder than words.

Pass a rope or a hook or a bar
Through an eyehole — that isn't bizarre.
But your eyeball should not
Get such things in its slot.
Such insertions stretch eyehole too far.

A rainbow without any rain?
The colors all washed out and plain?
It's a fogbow that's there,
Due to fog in the air.
(Which is wrecking my hair — what a pain!)

I'm agnostic, i.e., noncommittal.
The concept of God is a riddle;
Same for heaven and hell.
Others' "truths" just don't jell.
I devoutly inhabit the middle.

A cowp or a coup (or a coop)
Is not something about which you'd whoop.
It's a wagon or cart
With closed sides, used in part
For transporting malodorous gloop.

This follow-my-leader we're playing
Involves no political swaying.
We just copy each stunt
Of the person in front:
He dictates; we pursue him, obeying.

Must the flowers bloom roadside in vain?
You'd stay dry-shod indoors? Where's the gain?
Though our shoes may get wet,
Still we'll never regret
A good romp through the woods in the rain.

Film star Robert Donat played each part
With great skill and real feel for his art.
He put stars in eclipse
With Goodbye, Mr. Chips—
Won an Oscar for tugging each heart.

These barnacles sure are audacious;
They're growing in heaps! Goodness gracious!
It's my fervent belief
They will build up a reef
And their labors will prove corallaceous.

In her job as comparison shopper
For Macy's, Maude once came a cropper:
The info she got
About prices did not
Include Gimbel's top mop. How improper!

GPS, mp3, tiny phone,
Bluetooth earbuds, HD camera drone —
Electronic devices!
Affordable prices!
My gadgetry! All I can own!

Go outside of your foe's expertise.
Then he's forced to address what he sees
As irrelevant.  Surety
Drops; insecurity
Rises with blind-siding ease.

There's the who, there's the what, where and why:
These are words that emerge when I pry.
Curiosity's drive
Proves my brain is alive.
So tell all—I must know—and don't lie.

There are really six parts to our butts:
The big gluteus maximus juts
Out the most. It's outside,
And the one that gets eyed,
Like the pair on that model who struts.

The gluteus medius grips
The bone's surface outside of our hips,
And thus helps with our gait.
Plus, it's thick, which is great
To protect granny's hips if she slips.

Last, the glutei minimi, landing
Right under the medii's banding.
And if, on a whim,
You should stand on one limb,
These two pairs will help keep you up-standing.

The young captain opined, "I'm agin it.
Such a cadence has problems within it.
This double time races
Its thirty-inch paces—
One hundred and eighty a minute!"

If andante comes off slow and rough,
And allegro is not slow enough,
Allegretto might be
The precise cup of tea
For the music. Don't think so? Well, tough!

An Italian went to New York,
Where he lived upon nothing but pork.
For home he was pining:
With Roman cross-tining,
Spaghetti don't slip off your fork.

"He'll never eat that!" muttered Sid,
So we watched him, and blimey—he did.
His cake-hole could match
Any coal-loading hatch,
And his tongue's like a wheelie bin lid.

My husband, I swear, must be mental:
He's buying an engine that's dental.
With its faucet, its drills
And its airhose, the thrills
His new plaything will bring won't be gentle.

The butler, of mystery fame,
Is often the suspect to blame.
Though I trust my man, Lee,
When he brings me my tea,
The dog tastes it first, just the same.

In my garden, I've got quite a braw mix!
Enough cabbage for anyone's slaw mix,
Lots of herbs to peruse,
Fruits in all kinds of hues...
Glad I majored in home agronomics.

I've no authorly skill whatsoever;
I've tried penning some poems, but can't sever
My odd penchant for terse
Five-line doggerel verse
That skilled editors never find clever.

When converting a hundred and twenty litres
Into small metric units—say, centilitres—
You should multiply first
By a hundred; the worst
That can happen's you end up with plenty litres.

He was named Apocrisiary, when
The old Pope lacked an envoy, and then
Reaching Constantinople
As nuncio, pope-al,
Did business, and came back again.

My dad can distinguish the call
Of a bird, be it large or quite small.
He has learned every sound
That in nests can be found—
From the wren to the crow, one and all.

As we foundered, the ship broke apart,
And I blamed our new helmsman, young Bart.
Bart responded, "Why me?"
I said, "Didn't you see
All those marks labelled Rocks on the chart?"

Define it (this sense is historic),
The word that we call cataphoric:
Electric attractions
Cause movement, like actions
Of acids (perhaps hydrochloric).

As a dyed-in-the-wool Congregationalist,
I'm antitransubstantiationalist.
Bread and wine turns to Christ?
Nothing claimed has sufficed
To convince me it isn't sensationalist.

At Bushwood, young Danny the caddy,
A put-upon likeable laddie,
Is used by Judge Smails;
But soon justice prevails,
Which is all that she wrote for the baddie.

With droplets first sparingly spangle
A panel, then warily wrangle
It…so. Now you'll view—
Looking parallel to
The plane surface—a drop's contact angle!

They had scrambled so hard for the puck
That by accident someone got struck
In the face with a stick.
Retribution was quick —
On red ice, both the teams ran amok.

A cartoon in the newspaper Bild
Featured Lilli, whose doll later thrilled
Mainly men.  Girls as well.
But then Barbie's Mattel
Bought the rights and production was killed.

She had called him a bully back then
Since she longed for his kiss. (Come again?)
No, it's true. It was clear
That she held this man dear,
Since "back then" was around 1510.

Croatoan was carved on a post
Long ago in a fort on the coast
Of Virginia. A clue?
Maybe yes, no one knew,
But as colonies go, it was toast.

Your Auto-Tune's awful (amen!).
It puts vocals on-key, yes, but then
Your voice sounds like techno;
Am I listening? Heck no—
Don't ever make music again.

Chain reactors some think of today
As a cost savings energy play—
But a deadly emission
From uncontrolled fission
Is a paramount factor to weigh.

"Twelve Draughtsmen are Needed" proclaim
All my newspaper ads.  What a shame:
While responses I saw
Wanted jobs where they draw,
Still my board's short of discs for a game.

"I'm ecstatic we closed this big deal.
Let's shake hands.  How the heck do you  feel?"
"Yes, this contract, in fact,
Is a lucrative pact!"
 Yeah, for me — not for you. What a steal!

Double albatross? Too hard to say.
Triple eagle? It's cute but no way.
When you're four under par
On one hole, you're a star.
That's a condor — a very rare play.

His thinking's not what I'd call logical;
His rantings are quite demagogical.
He can't pull his weight
In a reasoned debate.
His arguments? Always hodge-podgical!

You were king, right? Of Italy?  Had you a
Need for more empire?  Well, Aduwa
Crushed your intent.
And the fallen were sent
Back to Rome, to Palermo, to Padua....

Look for antidunes crossing the bed,
In swift current. You'll spot them ahead
Through the early sun's gleam:
Hillocks inching upstream.
You'd expect they'd move downstream instead.

Ruled the judge, "It's a hanging offense!"
Said the lawyer, "That doesn't make sense.
Read the news, holy smokes —
We electrocute folks."
"The defense favors current events?"

On a night with no moon, deadly black,
Something sinister looks for a snack.
No mosquito or leech
Is the cause of that screech,
But the bloodsucking count who's named Drac.

It's like handball (a fast indoor game),
Where the venue (a court) is the same.
Served an ace, watched in awe
When it stuck in her bra.
That's how racketball first got its name.

"Our new logo," cried Hattie, emphatical,
"Needs a symbol, but not one aquatical.
We raise dogs; use a puppy,
You fool, not a guppy.
A canine's much more emblematical."

Angus Aberdeen called me a coof.
I said, "Thank you," polite and aloof,
Though I know better now.
Why, that ignorant cow!
It means "dolt," or "a  lout," or "a goof"!

A factor that's causatively rated
Is an input that someone has stated
Will provoke an effect.
But beware — don't expect
That connection to go undebated.

You've been asked to go see an avoyer;
You surely don't want to annoy her.
It's best not to agitate
This Swiss Canton magistrate,
So always appear with your lawyer!

We observed the new surgeon, were rapt
As the wound wouldn't close. He was trapped.
When the sutures all snapped,
The guy's future seemed sapped,
But with staples, he made it coapt.

"Hey, Paddy, you're scoring your flesh!
Your iPod is playing John Tesh!
What's up with your brain?
Why cause yourself pain?"
"Don't want to—I'm under a geas."

Is your credo dogmatic, bombastic,
Or rather elastic, more plastic?
Agnostic, or theist?
Atheistic, or deist?
Believe it or not: that's doxastic.

In English, we soften the C,
And we change the long "eye" sound to "ee".
It was "kaisahr" in Rome,
But from Key West to Nome,
It is "seezer" for people like me.

Fausto Coppi—the best ever seen;
He could climb or just break away clean.
He was thin as a pike;
His Bianchi-made bike
Was celeste (heavenly) green.

Deauration, the duchess was told,
Is to gild, or to cover with gold.
Chatsworth windows are such,
And the price wasn't much,
So she bought twice the quantity. Bold.

"That boatbuilder can't build a boat right;
Boats he builds for me never do float right!"
Having got the king's goat,
He was thrown in the moat.
"See, that boatwright can't float in the moat right!"

He began his novella, a conte,
With the setting, a place that we don't
Really see. And quite short
Ran the tale, to comport
With a "dark, stormy night"—Snoopy's wont.

Seven hours my soda had sat
In an uncovered can—that was that.
Lacking all carbonation
(That bubbly sensation),
Defizzed, now my Pepsi was flat.

I receive from my boss a grim clue:
"Joe, I'd like a quick word.  Come on through."
And I fear that he'll say:
"Our discussion today
Needs to centre directly on you."

Creamed corn? No, there's no dairy to it—
Just the kernels with gunk running through it.
On the cob, corn is utter
Delight spread with butter,
But creamed means it's easy to chew it.

A  Basque shepherd would bask in the sun
When his tasks with his sheep were all done.
He would lead them to graze,
And then he would raise
His flask and have lunch on the run.

His hive is so clean that it squeaks.
Just one spot and the beekeeper freaks.
So he shoots all the birds
That bombard it with turds,
Eats the corpses and heaps up the beaks.

The Akashic Record sets down
(And is held by some faiths in renown)—
'Til death and from birth—
Our life on this earth:
Each soul, every thought, every frown.

Floricultural my nature, my aim
Is to cultivate blooms. All the same,
I don't spend every minute
In my garden, though in it
I greet all my flowers by name.

In the gastrointestinal tract,
There are goblet cells—many, in fact.
They excel at producin'
A substance called mucin,
Which keeps the gut lining intact.

To get hired, Simon pees in a cup.
Driving home, he of course buckles up.
When his wife asks him, "Hey,
Did you have a nice day?"
Compulsorily, Simon says, "Yup."

In the '50s, when I was at school,
We spoke English according to rule.
Now the kids of today
Use some words their own way
Such as awesome, and innit, and cool.

Rats and cockroaches, we'll never beat 'em.
There's no hope that we'll ever defeat 'em,
For these creatures will flourish,
And our kind they will nourish,
Since the last living humans will eat 'em.

My new girl is an eye-catcher. She's
Got some really fine boobs—triple-Ds!
Guys just gape in a trance,
Then if caught, look askance
When she asks for a ten for a squeeze.

The young root peddler, smart and vivacious,
Shows knowledge both apt and capacious.
But singing the merits
Of parsnips and carrots
Neglects other foods apiaceous.

When the lifeboats are lowered, one calls
On equipment that's known as the falls.
I'd prefer, incidentally,
The name sets down gently
Considering the cargo it hauls.

We've discovered a large eccyesis.
Pains get worse as its volume increases.
Drugs or herbs won't improve it;
We'll have to remove it.
After surgery, pelvic pain ceases.

An online invitation we know
As an Evite (that's "E-vite"), although
Different stress was employed—
It meant "shun" or "avoid"—
When pronounced as "ih-VITE" long ago.

He seemed to be kind and assuaging,
But often was mean and enraging.
It seemed a foretoken,
And caused his bespoken
To find him no longer engaging.

A thermally stratified lake's
Top-most tier (epilimnion) makes
A warm, O2-rich layer—
Phytoplankton live there—
And gets skipped on by ducks and by drakes.

I looked at the check and yelled, "Hark!
They've omitted the decimal mark!
We've 5000, not 50.00 —
How fabulous, nifty;
Let's repay our big debt to that shark!"

There's a car with no wheels in your yard?
And your house with graffiti is marred?
Such envirocrime, Jack,
Will earn much-deserved flak:
Such misconduct, by statute, is barred.

"Bug-collecting all day is just weird,"
My playmates in grammar school jeered.
Would they care to apologize?
I now entomologize
For zoos with collections revered.

Socks and wellies or slippers with bows,
Strappy sandals for cooling the toes:
To protect her bare feet,
In the cold or the heat,
She dons footwear wherever she goes.

All my sisters and cousins and aunts
Wear out oodles of dresses and pants.
"New duds? Dime a dozen —
We're helped," says a cousin,
"By welfare and government grants."

The act of undressing, called baring,
Is sometimes considered quite daring.
Once, in Eden's green garden,
It needed no pardon —
There was neither undressing nor wearing.

My old car's like a stripper. She's hot,
Plus her shocks and her tranny are shot—
Boy, does she bump and grind!
One more thing comes to mind:
To keep quiet, she costs me a lot!

She prances to show how she feels,
In the style of her dancing ideals:
Now she twirls, Fred-and-Gingery,
Chancing an injury,
Backwards, and wearing high heels.

This fluorite variety might
Be a colour that really is  bright.
And Blue John is found
In a hole in the ground
Near Matlock, a popular site.

I have drunk, I confess, eau de vie,
But I fear that this drink's not for me.
For this rough-tasting brandy
Might make me feel randy,
Which I shouldn't, at my age, still be.

The baffling thing about guys
Is you never can tell by their eyes
If they offer romance
When they ask you to dance
Or it's lust that they thinly disguise.

Antique fashions among the well-heeled
Had the bongrace, a brimmed hat (a shield),
To provide some protection
For eyes and complexion;
From sun was a lady concealed.

"Trump is gaming the system," she said,
"Dodging tax laws!" But she is misled —
What she said is not true.
As most wealthy folks do,
He used legal tax loopholes instead.

Catfish noodling, it's true, is a sport
Of the strange, unbelievable sort.
With your fingers as bait,
For a bite you will wait
In the holes where the catfish cavort.

Given seven sins, son, sans contrition,
You've no hope in all hell of remission.
There's greed, gluttony, sloth,
Pride, lust, envy and wrath:
Damnability — road to perdition.

A grumpy old man of Berlin
Thought Wagner a terrible din:
So he couldn't endure a
Single bar of Walküre,
"And as for that dire Lo-hen-grin…!"

On the lead-tiled church rooftop he's lying,
In the moonlight, while stealthily prying
Off tiles, one by one,
Which he'll steal.  Oh what fun —
How he loves to go blue-pigeon flying!

Fleur-de-lys is an iris or lily
That you don't see in China or Chile,
But in heraldry (France)
You may find it by chance
When you visit Chambord or Chantilly.

When I first joined the army, my rank
Was buck private—the pay I got stank.
Though a buck is the lowest
An army grade goest,
Buck generals' lives can be swank.

An eccentric young woman, Nicole,
Has a lip-smacking death as her goal.
Chocolate poisoning's what
She aspires to, but
She's no horse, dog, cat, parrot, or vole.

When there's only one item, say some,
Agenda becomes agendum.
If the rule here implied
Were applied far and wide,
Would an Amazon's bra be a brum?

Eddie said to his teacher, with dread,
"Has your right eye been punched? It's all red!"
"Nope; wherever no white is,
There's episcleritis—
Where acute inflammation has spread."

You show no emotion at all:
Never laugh; never rage; never bawl.
Your apathy seizes you;
Lassitude pleases you!
Don't even bother to call!

A huge die-in is planned for today.
We'll lie down as though dead. In that way,
We can show our frustration;
A death demonstration
Makes points that mere words cannot say.

A blastomere's what you might beg
If you needed a fertilised egg
That you wanted to share
With your sister, and bear
Cousin-twins. (Are you pulling my leg?)

Here's the process of biofiltration
For raw sewage—try this explanation:
Good bacteria munch
On our waste for their lunch,
Decomposing it for the next station.

Though you carefully type your command,
The hardware just can't understand.
The interpreter reads
All the software it needs
To try to do what you had planned.

When emotions are running amuck,
But for four-letter words you are stuck,
Since the F-word's taboo,
There's not much you can do
But say "Feck!" if you're lacking in pluck.

In bilingual fun mum used to say
Sometimes, 'San fairy ann' to convey
With her 'off the hook' wit,
The above, meaning 'It
Doesn't matter'—in Anglo-Français.

To detrect extra spuds when you dine
Means when offered some more, you decline.
You detrect nasty booze?
You reject, you refuse—
Turn away or turn down or resign.

Human nature is quite acquisitional;
Our desire to acquire's unconditional.
 Even when we possess
 Far too much, nonetheless,
We are bound to keep wanting additional.

Since common sense is, at best, chancy,
And inventors endure flights of fancy,
Some American fools
Came up with some rules
And created a group known as ANSI.

"I'm committed to Caesar.  All hail!"
Cried a Roman, too eager for bail;
But his loyalty left
Him no license for theft,
And he's just been committed to gaol.

Someone sneezed in the lift just today.
In a jiffy all moved well away,
And no "bless you" was said
As the gathering fled.
COVID-19 concerns are at play.

Abu Hasan abruptly departed,
Chagrined when he publicly farted.
Despondent, in shame,
He was never the same —
Spent the rest of his sad life downhearted.

Sexy/sulky, moods mellow/dramatic,
In bed you're just sometimes ecstatic,
Senseless comings and goings,
Ceaseless hot and cold blowings:
You're erotic, my love — but erratic.

Walk walk walk! Walk walk walk! Walk walk walk!
My poor tootsies — they scream and they squawk!
I'm so painfully footsore
My feet are kaput-sore.
I limp and I trip.  People gawk.

One of man's diabolical tricks:
Add some brucine to alcohol; mix.
It's denatured—don't drink it,
And don't even think it
Makes sense, or you'll be in a fix!

I took note of the leaf and its shape,
How the vine would entangle and drape.
This was hops! Something's wrong:
It seemed not to belong
In the woodland—a garden escape.

I'm all ears means I pay strict attention
To your speech—a linguistic convention.
Not just ears, I have eyes,
Of course, kneecaps, arms, thighs,
And below-the-waist bits I could mention.

Ah, the ravishment — sweet violation —
And defilement. A precious sensation
From my droit de seigneur.
(Mustn't think about her —
Moral fibre can't beat constupration.)

Your retirement isn't too sharp,
So you're writing to Congress to carp.
Join a lobby, instead,
Of the old—nearly dead,
Soon in heaven and playing an AARP.

Deducibleness is conducive
To ideas becoming conclusive.
But when logic's disputed
And reason's refuted,
That outcome becomes more elusive.

At halftime we put on a show.
Our conductor is Dixieland Joe.
As we strut down the field
(Will this marching band yield?),
It's his mace that we chase to and fro.

The Castells were a singing quartet.
Though the mood for romance they would set,
Only two songs came through
('61, '62)
On the charts.  No more hits would they get.

When the cultural style of a nation
Is transformed by decree or migration,
So that language and dress
Are more Arab and less
What they were, that's arabicization.

Some smart ones win bets with their bookies;
Some tough ones are can't-be-stopped rookies.
They're internet trackers
And tasty for snackers.
You're sick if you toss 'em — they're cookies!

I imagine the following tiff
With the late Mr. Stone, now a stiff:
"When we came to that light,
He was wrong—I was right!"
"You're both dead," I reply. "What's the dif?"

The moon's a diminishing crescent,
Like my dwindling strengths—evanescent.
But I'm no old moon:
Don't expect me back soon.
(Someone bring me my antidepressant.)

This morning I rose bright and breezy,
Refreshed, in a mood light and easy.
Not like yesterday, say,
When I greeted the day
Thick of head and hung over and queasy.

In boreal climes, it would seem
Life's a permanent battle upstream…
Intense cold, little light—
Mere survival's a fight.
The Arctalian world is extreme.

Disgruntled, I recently heard,
Was a 17th century word.
And yet gruntled, I'm told,
Not a century old,
Was the wit of some word-loving nerd.

Bully critics are those who will draw
Stringent judgments that cut like a saw.
Those who give the best jeers
Of their lives to draw tears
Are renowned to be quick on the flaw.

So you're chilled by our central AC?
We can regulate flow, if need be,
With the moveable plate
In a damper. But wait.
There's a fee, sir, 'cause nothing comes free.

You're my alibi — you alone know
That I never left home. Please don't go
Till you've made it quite clear
To the plods I was here —
It's important, and crucially so!

The science developed to own
How the biosphere, Earth's living zone,
Interacts with another,
Its lithosphere brother,
Is as biogeology known.

Numbers, letters, and arrows appear
In the chemical formulae we're
Used to writing to show
That from H, C, N, O
We get most of our substance, my dear!

The day had gone past, and slave Gaius
And friend were still left on the dais.
He was suddenly smitten:
"Now check out that kitten!
I hope she won't go on right bias!"

You have all heard that dragons breathe fire.
But that's nothing compared to the ire
That my lady displays
When I err in my ways:
She harangues me so much I perspire.

They tried antidesertification —
Planted palm trees, installed irrigation.
But they can't understand
Why that great wall of sand
Still advances, engulfing their nation.

We consider the Earth really  sweet,
With free resources; thus we deplete
Nature's gifts year by year.
They will soon disappear,
And we'll cry in our beer—in defeat.

There was once a poetical man
Whose limerick lines didn't scan.
I'll offer a sample:
He wrote, for example,
"The Empire of the Rising Sun was Japan."

Please pity this miserable critic.
His outlook is glum and acidic.
He coughs and he wheezes,
Has several diseases—
His medicine? Antisyphilitic.

Obama caved in. Blues felt blue.
Single payer was dead; what to do?
I took comfort from Dad:
"He gave up, that's true, lad —
But Obama cares, child, for you."

Early on, shortly after the start
Of my social awareness, my heart
Ruled the way I perceived.
Over time, I achieved
Intellectual sway.  Now I'm smart.

When the kidneys are failing, we try
To implant an intact one. That's why
A twin sister—well, natch!—
Would provide a fine match,
If she deigns to accede—to comply.

The pyramid topped by an eye
Is a Freemason symbol? Oh, my!
That's what many folks feel
But it's only a seal
Used by plenty of others. Nice try.

A huntswoman, Lady Tamara,
Eschewed the more usual tiara
And wore on her head
Something furry and dead —
A large rodent she'd capped: capybara.

There's a tax form that makes me irate:
Form 1040, a long form I hate,
Due mid-April, each year,
With my check. (Will it clear?)
It's no wonder I always file late.

The student they loved to harass
Had the boniest assets, alas.
But with surgery (plastic),
She turned out fantastic:
The bonniest lass in the class.

Eric Bana, a comic Down Under,
Starred in movies that featured much plunder.
But he shed his Troy tunic
For a lead role in Munich,
Then played Henry the Eighth with great thunder.

If I'm too apathetic, then I'm
Unresponsive for most of the time.
 When there's work to prepare,
 I just stare and don't care;
I'm indifferent.

—But not with my rhyme!

Of the harness we use on the trail,
What's the part underneath the mule's tail,
Or the rear of a horse?
It's the breeching, of course!
(I thought breaching was done by a whale.)

As our dealership's sick of bad debt,
Repossession is no idle threat,
So we'll help (we are sweet)
Put you back on your feet
If you've not made your car payment yet!

It's a short-sighted species, the human,
So the death of the planet is loomin'.
Yet that seems to suggest
How it's best to invest,
As the bomb-building business is boomin'.

There's an accident blocking the road,
And the traffic has suddenly slowed.
When I pass by the wreck,
I start straining my neck,
As I'm draining a bottle I stowed.

There are two plants called dyeweed, it's true;
The second's called woadwaxen too.
It's a flowering weed
To which few folks pay heed,
As there's not much to see if they do.

One more day, one more typical gaffe.
"That's just Joe being Joe," says his staff.
Careless blunders amount—
They're too many to count.
So they worry who'll have the last laugh.

Though you've plenty to lose, stake it all.
No half measures, you'll stand or you'll fall.
You've got assets, so play,
Go for broke, seize the day,
Your best shot, at all costs, you must call.

It's a flame war we're waging on-line
Via e-mail: he jeers; I opine.
No one's wounded as such;
We're just keeping in touch.
Modern warfare's damned tough to define.

Do you want the whole crowd to adore
Your technique as you're looking to score?
If so, what you should strive
For's a sumptuous drive:
You'll look great while the ball runs for four.

"Wise Latina" is grilled to a sear.
Hill opponents dissect her career.
But cool Sonia does fine;
She's now one of the nine.
Those disjoiners deserve a Bronx cheer.

The abducens, a cranial nerve,
Innervates eye muscles with verve.
When you look to the side,
It makes your eyes glide
So you'll see what you want to observe.

When I praise your celerity, Gene,
Don't infer you are leafy and green
Like a celery stick.
What I mean is you're quick,
But you still might curtail the caffeine.

"I got angry last night and we fought
'Cause she told me my frenum's too short.
I tried and I tried,
But I'm always tongue-tied."
"You've got ankyloglossia, sport."

Trading votes on the House floor was why
Dick Gephardt was heard to decry:
"You misunderstand,
No revenge is at hand.
I just wanted an aye for an aye."

Acceptance is sometimes a state
Of submission and lying in wait.
You have given assent;
You are set and content;
You succumb to the finger of fate.

Absentee ends in "tee", you'll agree.
But its "or" buddy's missing, you see.
There is no absenTOR!
Let me say a tad more:
Absentor is a true absentee.

'Midst the sugar beets, soybeans, and corn
Is Bay City, a little well-worn.
It's important, in short,
As a Michigan port
(And the place where Madonna was born).

There's a need to inform Santa's elves
That more toys should be up on their shelves.
Does any one elf own
A land line or cell phone?
If so, we can tell them ourselves.

The officials in Texas-town Clark,
Voted coolly—their aim wasn't dark.
Their town's name is now DISH
And the reason's delish:
Free TV for 10 years. What a lark!

Bacillar means shaped like a rod,
To describe a bacterium's bod.
It's not used for a wand,
Or a reed in a pond.
Don't you find that a little bit odd?

Here's your baddha konasana guide:
Sit up straight, with one leg to each side
In this bound-angle pose,
Where you're holding your toes,
With your soles pressed together, knees wide.

"We're the three musketeers, country whoreson —
Athos, Porthos and Aramis. More, son:
All for one, one for all."
D'Artagnan has the gall
To say, "Let's be a foursome and score, son."

There are some revered things that most please
When they're absent — or down to the knees.
An example, perhaps,
Is those panties with straps,
The so-sexy, not Frenchy, chemise.

I'm in charge of this court, I admit.
A bencher? That's me. Here I sit
And consider anew
This young con artist who
Is convinced that I think he's legit.

Twelve more months have elapsed, and I fear
It's another long calendar year,
And your age is one more
Than it had been before.
What the hell! Happy birthday, my dear!

Cloth caps are the choice, on the whole,
Of the lord on his land, or the prole.
It's not middle-class headgear —
They'd not be seen dead, dear.
Now isn't the class system droll?

Last night my wife chafed me in bed,
Yes, she scolded me, face turning red.
"On this we agree:
You don't listen to me!"
(At least, that's what I think that she said.)

Uncle Stan liked the Barleycorn.  Pop
Says, "Malt liquor in hand was his prop
All too often.  Our clan
Likes to drink, but ol' Stan,
Rest in peace, didn't know when to stop."

Erythromelalgia's a curse.
You've got AIDS? This is many times worse.
Burning pains heat my feet.
They've turned red as a beet.
Call my doctor, then call me a hearse!

Cytotaxonomy? Well,
It's a way that one classes a cell
By its chromosomes, telling
Us how they're indwelling,
And how each one's structure befell.

Toward more specialized function's the norm.
From your stem cell, white corpuscles form.
Dedifferentiation?
Reversed situation:
From white cells to stem cells—a swarm.

Alley Oop's a Neanderthal hunter—
The stereotypical grunter.
Does the caveman remain
In the genes and the brain
Of the modern-day, manly affronter?

Metrosexual bible GQ
Is compulsory reading if you
Want a monthly, slick fashion
Magazine with a passion—
A gentleman knows what to do.

"You don't have to give yourself airs,
As if nobody else really cares
What our paper presents
About current events;
I say prayers about current affairs."

A Sahelian gazelle (found in Chad)
Is the addra. It's rufously clad.
For this species (N. dama),
A singular drama:
It's all but extinct. This is bad.

Some children in public are brattish,
Obnoxious, annoying, and rattish.
Their behavior is rude,
It's disruptive and crude:
And frankly, they drive me quite battish.

A. contortrix makes venom; this snake
Has some more tricks, like stealth and tail shake.
Camouflaged, he'll sit tight
Till provoked and then bite,
So you'd best get him first with a rake.

This country club's dress code's unfair!
The women are told what to wear.
They must put on a bra,
Even when in the spa,
When it's so much more fun to go bare.

The chocolate hostage, room 10,
Hasn't pooped since we don't know just when.
If strong laxatives can't
Bring relief more than scant,
We'll be bobbing for apples again.

An old deep-sea diver named Fred
Often sinks with a feeling of dread,
So he prays every night
That his helmet's air-tight,
Since he's always in over his head.

Circumcellions loved a good fight,
And viewed death in a positive light.
A good martyrdom plot
Gets you killed on the spot.
(Or it will if you're doing it right.)

You'd bet dollars to donuts, you said,
That before this thing's done, you'd be dead.
Your conclusion's foregone;
Make that dahlias, you're on.
When you croak, I want flowers instead.

An old rubber band will go wacky;
All brittle and sticky or tacky.
But what will protect
It before it gets wrecked?
Antiozonants do it, by cracky!

The tanning of hides, alutation,
In a less-common manifestation
May expose nether regions
Of Danes and Norwegians
Who lie on a beach on vacation.

His whole face, due to cicatrization,
Seemed embossed with his tribe's variation:
Long raised welts on the skin
From his pate to his chin,
Like some gruesome engraved invitation.

You're aggressively loud-mouthed and pouting,
And your lecturing leaves no one doubting
Your haranguing lacks class,
As you yell through your arse.
You deserve a good clouting… STOP SHOUTING!

Your diet worked great, so you've shrunk.
Now your swimsuit falls off when you dunk.
In the surf, you'd supposed,
Bodies don't get disclosed—
But it's time to go home, so you're sunk.

He is blessed with a beautiful bod,
And his roles range from weird to just odd,
But the wonderful rep
Of the star Johnny Depp
Won the role of (my God!) Sweeney Todd.

Simple elegance cues my reaction
To Babinet's principle's action:
We see the same fringes
From light that impinges
On disks, or on holes, from diffraction.

"Better stop, or I'll shoot," he exhorted.
I lay down, and my gun he abstorted.
A mere lad, three years old
(Though he looked mighty bold),
With a cap-gun my bank-job has thwarted!

On the waterfront, owners were greedy
For freighters whose loading was speedy.
What made longshoremen know
They'd been going too slow?
Coulda been a container ship, Edie.

It turned business-as-usual around,
When the whites in the South sadly found
How things then had to be:
A bus boycott set free
The brave blacks, firmly standing their ground.

The world is awash in unlawfulness;
It's a horrible stick-in-your-crawfulness.
We're closing our drapes
To the killings and rapes.
Is there any escape from this awfulness?

If you look at the phrase Q.E.D.,
A gerundive is something you'll see.
For the D, all alone,
Means "the thing to be shown".
"Demonstrandum" conveys "it must be".

There's a glaringly obvious flaw
In your case. You implied that a law
Is irrelevant when
It is written by men.
Any blind man could see what I saw.

"Let's get earthy!" she purred, in a skirt
So close-fitting and short that it hurt.
I'm a fool, it appears:
For the last thirteen years
She's done nothing but treat me like dirt.

"The current's a tease in these parts,"
Said the captain, "but I've got some smarts.
Where's the channel? Don't know,
But I'll call down below
For a sailor to bring me some charts."

All-day singings are held in our small
Rural church, courtroom, schoolhouse, or hall.
Singing hymns, we rejoice
(In four sections by voice):
Each, in turn, leads the group.  What a ball!

Abduction, in logic, finds reason:
If secrets were leaked, there was treason.
It's cause-estimation
From clear observation.
You smell something bad? Likely me, son.

Take two pyramids, glued base to base,
A symmetrical figure of grace.
Each triangular face
Has an edge you can trace:
A dipyramid shape's in that space.

Affluenza's the sickness I caught:
Guilt from all of the riches I sought.
Unfulfillment's what reigned
The more goods I attained.
Truly, happiness cannot be bought.

In the countryside, fair and arboreal,
The language is less dictatorial.
Those dialects dear
To my populist ear
Sound charmingly quaint and enchorial!

Red VW, '73,
New PW, batt, & AC,
Auto, cruise, ABS,
PS no, PL yes,
With low mi & vg MPG.

If you've secrets, I'll listen — feel free
To divulge them — but I'll guarantee,
If you do, then I'll blab
(I've the gift of the gab);
Blow the gaff (just between you and me).

"Will it play in Peoria?" was,
In the past, often asked to mean "Does
It have mainstream appeal?
Take their pulse, get a feel,
And we hope it sparks positive buzz."

Having written a passionate tome
To his far distant girlfriend, Jerome,
When he'd finished the note,
On the envelope wrote
The word BURMA and posted it home.

I dare you to stop me from crying!
There's a sure-fire way, no denying.
With your hands tease my ears
And you'll soon ease my tears:
That's a challenge that's clearly worth trying.

Different metals united as one,
And used, say, in parts of a gun —
These alloys are stronger,
Corrode less, last longer
Than metals in "pure form" have done.

The basement I work in's not cheery.
Underground, without windows, it's dreary.
My foremost complaint
Is that sunny, it ain't!
Just being down here makes me weary....

I shall fight tooth and nail for promotion.
I shall work day and night; such devotion
Will secure my position
And clear competition
(In whose coffees I'll pour poison potion).

I'm a versatile boy in the choir,
Who's a little bit straight, yet on fire.
I sing tenor or bass;
It's a role I embrace:
A bisectional pro, now for hire.

Slash Social Security?  Note:
That would ruin my chance with the vote
Of the young generation
Across this great nation.
I'd rather not cut my own throat.

In my home, you must stumble and grope—ick!—
For my housekeeping eye is myopic.
I need help, I'm afraid;
Don't just send me a maid—
I need someone who's antientropic.

These bees' stingers have barbs. Nope, not funny.
And, whether it's cloudy or sunny,
Tribe Apini spends hours
Getting pollen from flowers
Which is why it is hairy-eyed, honey.

My submission is such a disgrace
That the judges will give me last place:
Granny squares were assigned,
But those judges will find
That I made only colbertine lace.

While the artwork's not overly pretty,
And the dialog's not all that witty,
Bobby Make-Believe's fame
Can be guessed by his name:
He's pre-Thurber, a child Walter Mitty.

Must you bang on that agony box?
My head hurts clear down to my socks!
Can you play the piano?
I say, man oh man, no!
Your fingers all seem to be rocks.

Fetoproteins, unseen since the womb,
When they surge late in life, may spell doom.
If they're alpha, the answer
May be liver cancer —
More tests may yet save you from gloom.

Not to curtsy was surely a slip,
One that could have been eased with a quip;
But her escort, she'd find,
Sadly, wasn't that kind —
"Way to go, cherie," curled off his lip.

Appearing on Capitol Hill,
Sandy said, "I can't pay for the pill.
I would like to get laid
With my birth control paid.
Let insurance take care of the bill."

When the bishop besought the Lord's grace,
He'd choose blessings befitting his place
From his own benedictional.
Neither fact-based nor fictional,
Its words were kept handy… in case.

The order of Primates is known
For aping whatever they're shown.
From toenail to nape,
We're practically ape,
And purchase the toys our friends own.

Dispatch is exactness and speed
With efficiency—something you need
When your butt's being whomped
And you look for a prompt
Way to stop it. The answer? Concede!

I can see why you're looking so pale.
Your dumb bum of a son — me —'s in jail.
I could do with, now, Mum
— That is, benefit from —
A small sum, just a crumb, for my bail.

Apotactics renounced having stuff,
Thereby calling the hypocrites' bluff.
They avoided transgressions
By shedding possessions,
But felt that they still had enough.

When critiquing your trip from this town,
Roger Ebert, please smile and don't frown.
Tell us, how long's the stint?
If you can, send a hint:
Is the next life thumbs-up or thumbs-down?

To a building that looks like a yurt,
They ride in and let treasures divert.
From the Capitol steppes
You know each of these Reps
Will just take while you give till you hurt.

Competition occurs when resources
Are scarce; what it leads to, of course, is
Succeeding and breeding
Or feeble receding:
Selection by natural forces.

A cosset's a little pet lamb
That has recently come from its dam.
You should cosset yours while
It is small.  What a trial
When you pamper a fully grown ram!

Now Hannibal's one to opine
That broad beans go well with red wine.
With liver or lamb
(Or starling, or ham)
Chianti's especially fine.

"Bosworth Field is where I will defend
My great realm," Richard cried, "I'll not bend!"
But soon he was forced
To concede, when unhorsed,
"I've a hunch that my reign's at an end."

Those men who are wearing big boots
Whisper slyly as one of them moots
Something sinister — what,
The Gunpowder Plot?
They're with Guy Fawkes; they're all in cahoots.

What's the sole US state in the land
Where the gas pumps are constantly manned?
You've an old law to thank—
You can't fill your own tank
In New Jersey. Self-service is banned!

The banana squash coloring's cream.
These you bake or puree, even steam.
They grow well in the sun;
Be prepared, though, to run—
If you bring one more box I will scream.

Curiosity drove a young fellow
(Still a virgin) to try a bordello.
Walking in, he was nervous,
But, thrilled with the service,
Left later that night feeling mellow.

Here's an anagram (not my devising),
And it doesn't need any revising.
Do you find it odd
That "dog" becomes "god"?
Well, I find it quite unsurprising.

He's the subject of heated debate,
And a few want to show him the gate.
A bête noire is this pest
Who bedevils the nest.
He's the black hat the white hats all hate.

In a cave near the Mediterranean
We sheltered (the day was a rainy 'un);
While thus cavernicolous
My girl suffered knicker loss,
And we sampled delights subterranean.

They say Carl XVI Gustaf's big
Out in Stockholm, their biggest bigwig.
King of Sweden is he.
1973
Marked the start of that very sweet gig.

We'll dismantle the double-wide, Heather,
Split the halves and protect them from weather—
Looks like you get the bed;
I, the toilet, instead...
Girl, we might as well get back together.

For my first job, let's say I got through it;
It was dirty work, sure, but I knew it —
Pumping, well, you know, "it"
From each foul septic pit.
I just figured that someone must do it.

There's a sign at the end of my land
Saying "Canines officially banned!"
To avoid being bitten,
I had the sign written
In Dog so those mutts understand.

Yeah, you'll rock when you play on his daxophone
(Though your glockenspiel's fine, this gem packs a tone).
You'll get Bach from a tongue
(On a block) which is sprung.
Please don't knock it—he'll bring out his saxophone.

When he entered the bank he looked tough.
Both his voice and his manner were gruff,
But the gun in his hand
Bore a tag—"Hasbro Brand
Squirting pistol"—I called the guy's bluff.

"You'll be fast-tracked to stardom," they said,
"With your songs lodged in everyone's head.
Sign your name! There's no risk!
Then we'll cut your first disc."
But he chose to go solo instead.

Now that I'm old (past maturity),
My entitlement's clear — it's a surety.
Every month I get cash
From the government's stash.
Thank heaven for Social Security.

You're a  bore, if you know what I mean;
When you exit, you brighten the scene.
Oh, what yawns you promote.
(On a positive note,
You're a great antidote to caffeine.)

On the apron, the actor died badly,
Far too close to the audience, sadly.
When the curtain then fell,
He was still to be well
In full view. They applauded him madly.

Jed knows that the problem's genetic.
Toward gout all his clan's diathetic—
So he takes little pills
For preventing these ills,
And stays healthy, pain-free, and athletic.

Our new boss was an instant sensation;
He designed an ornate presentation.
Dog and pony show? Sure,
But it's bound to secure
All our customers' pure admiration.

There once was an amateur choir
Whose talents would never inspire.
Their rhythm was stalling,
Their tuning, appalling—
I tell you, their concerts were dire.

Far from perfect am I, though superior
In all that you see — my exterior.
But I'm rotten inside;
I have so much to hide!
My interior sucks — it's inferior.

"I am part of the Gingerbread coven,"
Said the witch as she fired up her oven.
"We bake kids into toys:
Ginger girls, ginger boys.
Ready, Hansel? Now Gretel, quit shovin'!"

Tiny flaws were the cause of the fact
That we lacked big applause for our act.
So we thought about brushing
It up, and were rushing
To fix it when (ack!) we got sacked!

"Not…a bang, but a whimper," he wrote.
Those few words had the world by the throat.
T. S. Eliot knew us,
In fact, saw right through us:
We'd end bitterly — hell of a note!

Don Antonio, Boss of All Bosses,
Said, "Our rackets are suffering losses!
Let's work harder at crime
And stop wasting our time
Searching Google for pasta and sauces!"

Acid reflux is heartburn, you know.
After rich creamy foods — feel the flow
From the stomach down south,
Rising into the mouth;
Gastric acids should stay down below!

When Don Juan invades an alcazar,
Climbing in where the holes full of glass are,
He can make Ladies weak
With his hair black and sleek:
His pomade is the oil of Macassar.

The ablepharous adder relies,
When he hunts, on his quickness and size,
But it surely can't hurt
That he's always alert,
Since he doesn't have lids on his eyes.

In business, where waste is provoking,
Our days are consumed with colloquing.
We meet and converse
While our problems grow worse.
Let's sit down and discuss why we're choking.

My daughter, it seems, has a flair
For rhyming with great savoir-faire.
She's having a fling
At this limerick thing;
It's becoming a family affair!

I wuz shovellin' sugar, no sass—
Gotta slap in me face from me lass.
She near left me half dead
On account of I said,
"Hon, you sho gotta load of bagasse."

A propeller can cause the creation
Of bubbles, whose manifestation
Appears to be boiling
In water that's roiling.
The process is called cavitation.

Here's a list of the dances I know:
The Watusi, the Cotton-Eyed Joe,
The waltz, carioca,
Fandango, and polka.
(Six down and a million to go.)

You ride bathyscapes like submarines,
Underseas: cruise the blues and the greens.
Embark through the hatch.
Get sealed in. Lock the latch.
Now you're canned like a school of sardines.

I have told you, son, time and agen,
Eat you not with such drunkenlew men.
They will lead you astray,
First in drinking all day,
Then in seeking Iniquity's den.

It's building a fire under folks
That successfully spurs and provokes
Them to vigorous action.
Let's wake up this faction—
Our hotfoots ain't meant to be jokes!

If worked leather you're hoping to sell,
You must learn where to pause for a spell.
Correct use of hot brass
Is a pain in the ass.
Often, tooling requires a dwell.

You think fatty infiltration's obese
Folks invading, disturbing the peace?
Nope, it's way too much fat
Where it shouldn't be at —
In your organs — quit eating that grease!

Today's challenge, debaters? Your mission's
To defend two conflicting positions.
Argue anti and pro,
And the victor will show
Clever use of well-chosen munitions.

"The plot of this script's a surprise—
A magician's adventures," Di cries.
"It's a show we can serialize.
Watch the guy dematerialize—
Disappear right in front of your eyes!"

There's a house on the crest of the hill
That gives children a terrible thrill.
It's cloaked in a creepiness
That reduces to weepiness
Any girl who is caught in its chill.

A shoulder joint's causing alarm:
Have I collarbone-scapula harm?
My acromioclavicular
Pain is articular—
Prompted by raising my arm.

When she weeps and her lips are aquiver,
Her response is: "I'll drink me a river!"
But her drink isn't water,
So now my dear daughter
Has cirrhosis (you guessed) of the liver.

When  claymation performers ain't viable
Like Wallace and Gromit,  they're liable
To seem less than dynamic —
Let them bake to ceramic,
And start over with clay, 'cause it's pliable.

In her dressing gown, Cindy will wait,
Watching minutes crawl by till her date.
"Won't you hand me my dress?
Does my hair look a mess?"
But, alas, her Prince Charming is late.

An adventurous gal liked to spend
Her vacations abroad where she'd blend,
Eating local cuisine
(The indigenous scene),
But contracted dire rear in the end!

"This is ice plant," called out my Aunt Erma.
"See it growing right here on the berm, a
Plant with blooms yellow, pink,
Or magenta, I think.
It's a succulent called Delosperma."

Glasswing butterflies may not be bright,
But low-profile is what they do right;
The most wondrous of things
Are their fenestrate wings:
Far less visible, clearly, in flight.

Wearing shorts, went a man one December
For a jog, but he failed to remember
To protect private parts
(He was lacking in smarts),
So he froze both his backside and "member".

My doctor cares not, I suppose.
He's aloof to my pains and my woes.
"Doc, I've got a bad cough!
And my leg's fallen off!"
"Oh, grow up!" he says. "That's cured your toes."

I shall pose you a musical riddle,
One I learned of when playing the fiddle.
Though it tends to confuse,
What's the word one should use
When a music score ends in the middle?

Sweet Jesus, protect me, my friend,
From phenomena I apprehend:
Dogs, spiders, dark places,
Frogs, snakes, open spaces,
Bogs, aliens... Heaven forfend.

The one missing from Grace, out of place?
The drunk sot with the beery-eyed face.
He is now not allowed
To hang out on our cloud.
It's the third time he's fallen from grace.

Ronco ads on TV I adore —
Loud and fast, they are never a bore!
And just when you feel
You will get a great deal,
 "But wait," Popeil hollers, "there's more!"

Your deed's signed, Sir, it's sealed and embossed.
All the i's have been dotted, t's crossed.
Now, we don't like to boast,
But it's finely engrossed
(Which entails, I'm afraid, added cost).

If you're after a gift that's refined,
Showing insight and presence of mind,
Ask around in the town
For an aptotic noun
Such as "sheep," since it can't be declined.

Once a centipede, lacking in luck,
By dismembering mishap was struck.
Now it's hampered by one
Wooden leg. Can't be fun
When with ninety-nine bonk! you are stuck.

See that guy in the modest blue blazer?
That intensely rapt candle-flame gazer?
My opinion's secure:
He's an arsonist, sure.
Zap that fire-raiser now with your taser!

Some reasons for colonization,
Long ago, were to fund exploration
And send back to the old
Country, furs, fruits, and gold—
Then export an excess population.

As a child I would cry in my bed,
Fooled by stories that filled me with dread.
I'd see monsters quite mean
Who would glow pink and green;
Such babyshed left my eyes red.

When my dad was a surgeon he went
Every Christmas to hospital, spent
Lunchtime carving the bird—
Though the patients preferred
Christmas pudding, one hundred percent!

The Bruins of Boston were great
In the '70s—early, not late.
A defenseman named Orr
(Bobby wore #4)
Used to score at a staggering rate.

"In a film or a vid that you've made,
When a shot ends, a new one is laid
On the first, so they merge,"
Said film editor Serge,
"In a process we call a cross-fade."

On audacity, daring and bold,
And his confident air, we were sold.
In the path he's now leading
Us down, there's no heeding
Restraint — we face wreckage untold.

There are twelve of these cards in the deck,
With a head and a face and a neck.
Though the court is the scene
For the king and the queen,
What's the jack doing there? Someone, check!

It's a transitive verb, is demount,
Meaning "take off its mounting". No fount
Deftly spouts, wordly-wise,
An intransitive guise.
"Will this unit demount?" — would that count?

All his daughters want haircuts and perms,
But he thinks of the prices, and squirms.
So I say to him, "John,
Go to Hector's salon,
Make an offer and bring him to terms!"

God's particle? What are you smoking?
(Oh, sorry, I see you were joking.)
That boson, the Higgs,
Made the science do jigs:
Deep secrets at last are uncloaking.

The bronze bell-roof atop that tall tower
Represents, it's said, masculine power.
That flaring metallic
Homage to the phallic
Casts a shadow that grows by the hour.

Stately homes — or some castle or gallery —
I try not to visit with Valerie.
When it comes to the end
Of our tour she will spend
In the giftshop two-thirds of my salary.

Exclamation marks have been explained,
But a useful fact's still to be gained:
You will not know that 4!
Is factorial, nor
Twenty-four if you haven't been trained.

This painting's called 'Walrus on Ice'.
It's done in acrylics — they're nice:
Neither thick, nor yet trickly,
They dry pretty quickly,
And colours mix well in a trice.

Not yet married, I wish her success
And more joy than mere words can express.
But the gown for her wedding
Shows her abdomen spreading.
She's a damsel, of course, in this dress.

Touch a burner, it's followed by burning,
Whereupon you'll no longer be yearning
To try this again,
Since the lesson is plain—
And it's known as associative learning.

When driving your car, stay alert,
And improving your diet won't hurt.
The statistics don't lie,
You will probably die
From a crash or an ice cream dessert.

We all thought them a helluva team
Till they crashed with a shared primal scream.
Now of course they're divorced,
With all intercourse forced—
Oddly labored, like swimming upstream.

He'd been calling me "doofus" and "geek,"
So I worked on my boxing technique.
But my roundhouse proved lame
When his counterpunch came;
I was spitting out teeth for a week.

If you're looking to buy marijuana
Or to purchase, perhaps, an iguana,
It's not pesos, my friend,
That you're going to spend;
You'll need cedis when shopping in Ghana.

You know that a study's controlled
When half of the patients enrolled
Got placebos instead
Of the drug, and they're dead,
While the other half just got a cold.

Get the book John Brown's Body  today
By the famed Stephen Vincent Benét,
Who, poetic and wise,
Won a Pulitzer Prize—
Then at age 44 passed away.

The detection for firedamp did shine.
'Twas enough to explode the whole mine.
The surveyors, perplexed,
Said, "If afterdamp's next,
Can't see how that canary is fine."

In cursive she's penning her story
Of trysts with three dashing signori.
Her penmanship nourishes
Purple-prose flourishes
In curlicued, loop-the-loop glory.

We boatbuilders hired a kid
To varnish a deck. The kid slid,
Fell, and made a fine mess,
No one told him, I guess,
"Don't fall down on the job!" But he did.

If a tree in a forest coniferous
(All fragrant with pine, so odiferous)
Falls, though nobody's there,
And then dies, do we care?
Does it suffer a death doloriferous?

At NASCAR, the crew chiefs are czars
Who manage their lead-footed stars,
Those guys who prove deft
Turning left left left left,
Plus the guys who bolt wheels on the cars.

When I once held my breath for too long,
I was left with no words and no song—
In fact, nothing at all,
And to further appall,
I suspect that I started to pong.

Now an area isn't 3-D;
It's just length times the width, don't you see.
But an aria's better —
Just changing one letter
Gives volume — but too much for me!

Attackers approaching our fort
Will find we're not easy to thwart.
We've bastions, with faces
Between them.  This place is
A redoubtable fortress, in short!

We could flatten the curve of disease
By enforcing these stringent decrees:
Wash your hands (simple task);
Keep apart; wear a mask.
Can it work? We should ask the Chinese.

A coach is a long-distance bus.
(You recall "Leave the Driving to Us"?)
You can get yourself, cheap,
Coast to coast fast asleep.
Over cars, that's a definite plus.

The Phelpses produced a young laddie
Called Jock—he was known as a baddie.
A porter by trade,
He often "mislaid"
People's trunks, so he made a poor cadie.

There's a trend: one particular gender
Is more nurturing, caring and tender,
While the other might think
How to get you to drink
When he's mincing a frog in a blender.

Botryoidal — like fruit of the vine:
It's used when you wish to define
The odd types of shapes
Made by bunches of grapes;
So think about that with your wine.

Learning solfège, you've two ways to go:
Either fixed Do or movable Do.
When it's fixed, we agree,
Do will always be C.
(It's the tougher way, just so you know.)

For avoidance of theft, let's suppose
A museum opts not to expose
Its relics to view.
So, leaving no clue,
Artifactual copies it shows.

Which Ivy League school didn't gel
Until after King George's rule fell?
Seven others existed
Ere this one was listed.
Does this "Ithaca" clue ring a bell?

I've reached my old age when I find
That my body is creaking; my mind
Is—well—absent. So, please—
It's "old-timer's disease".
Show some patience with me and my kind.

Because of the hall where they play,
Cleveland Orchestra members, they say,
Don't have to be fired,
Laid off or retired
To garner their Severance pay.

The best vintage I hope to obtain
From my vineyard, a lauded domaine.
But this batch just won't fly
As it turned out too dry,
So I'll dose all these casks of champagne.

The tribes of the Berbers once spread
Over all from Sahara to Med.
In the Muslims' great quest
To push far to the west,
Their vast army by Berbers was led.

In bright-field microscopy, bright
Background lighting is uniform, white.
And an image is made
As this brightness must fade
Where the sample's obstructing this light.

We're so loud you can feel the ground shaking,
Yet no law on the books are we breaking.
We'll erupt, yell, and shout
Till at last we drown out
Any sense that the candidate's making.

Who is faster? Is Algie? Or Hal?
When compared for a race, or a gal?
Hal will reach the tape first,
But a lover? The worst!
Brother Algie ran off with Hal's pal.

Mixing beeswax with pigment's the way
That encaustic  is made, to this day.
What's produced is a kind
Of paint; one will find
That when treated with heat, it will stay.

With an intricate, madcap device—
Pulleys, cap-pistol, candle, some ice,
Levers, cheese, plate, boot, spring,
Bottle-rocket, some string—
Reuben Goldberg could get rid of mice.

Dad-blast is a kind of a sham.
I use it in lieu of, umm… d*mn.
For you see,  I'm genteel;
Being pure's my appeal.
Dad-blame it,  that's just who I am!

My harvest is ruined. I'm bust,
And this fungus has caused my disgust.
First with cedar it grapples;
It then infects apples—
This blight has been aptly called rust.

As the lockdown continued, my hair
Grew e'er longer.  I'd inches to spare!
I did what I dared do,
A DIY hairdo.
That coronacut, though, needs repair.

There are things that don't seem to make sense:
British bankers wrote "d" to mean pence.
Latin penny — not "p",
But denarius, "d".
Now it's "p" for new pennies from hence.

I whispered to her, "It is true —
I am helpless, don't know what to do.
The words that I fear
To breathe in your ear
Can't be unsaid once said: I love you."

"The play," said the overwrought critic,
"Was unto my heart catalytic.
The theme seared my soul
Like a slow-burning coal—
My review will proclaim: 'Anthracitic!'"

Cried Cassandra, "Don't bring that Greek horse
Into Troy, or you'll feel great remorse!"
Could she prophesy? Yes.
But alas, one fine mess!
None believed her, so fate ran its course.

A baculovirus sounds odd:
It's quite large and it's shaped like a rod,
And it only takes posts
In invertebrate hosts.
It's a stranger to eggplants or cod.

Banaras, in Uttar Pradesh,
Is where Hindus like dipping their flesh
In the Ganges—a river
So cold many shiver.
Who cares if the water ain't fresh?

My cigarette holder (no joking)
Is both practical and thought-provoking.
As a primary strength,
It's two meters in length.
It helps keep me away, see, from smoking.

Three Auerbachs make our lives brighter.
First there's Red.  As a coach, he's a fighter.
Then there's Frank.  He's an artist.
And last up, the smartest,
Our Jane is a limerick writer.

We thought we had found a good deal,
For these sandalwood scents seemed a steal.
But this stuff is just rot;
We're incensed, and we're not;
We were duped, 'cause this dhoop isn't real!

Our Dean was a true acad.
Who hugely enjoyed a pol.
But a student then started
Who was not so lighthearted —
And the rows soon became epid.

Cazuela, a soup that's served hot,
Contains pumpkin, believe it or not.
Then there's meat, beans, and rice,
And sliced carrots are nice.
Big in Chile, I like it a lot.

If a nuclear missile you lob
At a town, radiation will prob-
ably wipe out the lot;
But if perchance not,
Then the blast wave will finish the job.

Our shortstop, by swinging a maul,
Squashed the horsehide to mush. I said, "Paul,
You mistook my intent;
That was not what I meant
When I asked you to field a ground ball."

The Benevolent League of Tooth Fairies
Finds the mood of its membership varies
When it comes to a vote,
Yea or Nay, to promote
Or to actively fight active caries.

With the foot soldiers hitting the streets,
Life's less taxing for office elites,
Who avoid the mundane,
Stay in out of the rain,
Asses covered and counting receipts.

"You may find my new pets unfamiliar:
They are cross-breeds — of group Crocodilia.
Just watch while I mate a
Recalcitrant gator
And a caiman (hold still there now, will ya?)."

I'm expunging this line so you'll see
What this editing term means to me.
In this way, I'm assured
The line's meaning is blurred
To a greater or lesser degree.

The term bent can be slang, meaning "gay,"
Yet Bent River's a cheese with cachet.
With very few flaws, it
Is not in the closet.
Go straight out and buy some, I'd say.

Biographically challenged from birth,
I can tell what my life-story's worth.
Though it might appear cuter
If told à la Pooter,
Of page-turning smut there's a dearth.

Cholangiography's my expertise—
I am licensed and have two degrees
In this x-ray technique
That is used when we peek
At your bile ducts in search of disease.

While sitting one night at the bong,
We were challenged to beer pong. The throng
Rose at once to the dare.
But, alas, the room's air
Soon stank with a rank used-beer pong.

"I've no bandwidth for that," some folks say.
It's their style of responding, "No way!
I've no time. I am beat.
I have deadlines to meet.
I'm maxed out. I can't help you.  Okay?"

It's not praise when you're called contumacious,
Nor a hint that you're gentle and gracious.
It means you're a cow,
You stubborn old sow,
Pig-headed, perverse and pugnacious.

Wherever an eagle may fare,
The air will be bearing him there.
He'll be borne on the breezes
And soar where he pleases,
On naught but a wing and a prayer.

This codling's a beam to be cleft
Into staves; and the bundle that's left,
After that, will be lining
For coffins confining
The loggers of whom we're bereft.

My chromatographic techniques
Are the envy of chemistry geeks.
I separate mixtures
In hour-long fixtures—
A task that can take others weeks.

It's clear aplanats fix all distortion,
Whereas achromats fix just a portion.
So it's hard not to hype
Adolph Steinheil's lens type;
Thanks to him, views stay true — no contortion.

On the prairie, boudin was a treat:
Roasted buff gut instead of mere meat.
While the cook worked at stuffing it,
By the fire we'd sit, roughing it.
Before long, "The white pudding's complete."

"This food is so good; it's delish.
Can you tell me the name of this dish?"
"It's so tasty, like salmon,
And lovely to jam in
Your mouth. Why it's ayu, the fish!"

We humans love airy creations,
Concocting etherealizations.
We perceive unreal heroes;
Exposed, they're plain zeroes,
Upsetting our high expectations.

The writing was there on the wall,
Yet we paid no regard, none at all.
"We'll continue to win,"
We proclaimed with a grin —
Then the bottom fell out of our call.

I'm on Boardwalk and ready to throw
But old Vlad, my opponent's, so slow.
It's such a short dash
To collect needed cash,
But I'm sitting, awaiting Go dough.

Coriolis and force should divorce.
You can fly round in circles, of course,
But this spurious thing
Won't have helped you take wing
Though you spin it as "force" till you're hoarse.

"Now Doc, though I know I'm not ill,
My face is blotched brown," said young Jill
"What you have is chloasma,
A form of melasma.
You're pregnant, or else on the pill."

Though the program I wrote seems secure,
There's a back door put in to ensure
Easy access. Some day
I may use it as, say,
A duplicitous entrepreneur.

We politely progress through our paces
At arm's length to finesse public spaces,
Keeping stranger or peer
From approaching too near
And exhaling up close in our faces.

We complain that school's hard back in Kitly.
As is suitable, Kit answers fitly,
But her comment's not pretty.
"Enough of self-pity!
In the Bronx it's much worse," she says. "WHITLY!"

He bilks me in cribbage by thwarting
My chances of scoring—not sporting!
The way that he does it?
By bilking—because it
Is cheating to which he's resorting.

Have you heard of the old chambered tombs?
They are gravesites that have many rooms.
With your relatives, share
Where you lie in death there.
PHEW! Imagine the family fumes!

Smuggling dogs through the customs today?
If you've got one you've squirreled away,
We will search out your pup,
And we'll never give up —
We will ferret it out — and you'll pay!

A house is a prime acquisition
(And a mortgage a major ambition)
That people who rent
Should have every intent
To pursue till it comes to fruition.

Are you people who like this insane?
It's a cabbage that looks like a brain!
While it lies in my power,
I'll shun cauliflower
With distrust, plus disgust and disdain!

It was Latin-like, ancient, quite priscan—
The language that's known as Faliscan,
And spoken so prettily
In long-ago Italy.
Did that tongue have a word for spheniscan?

I've got limerick lines on the brain.
It's beginning to drive me insane.
It's a sleep-loss afflictive,
Completely addictive,
Intellectual-type crack cocaine.

"This secret's between you and me.
What I told you is on the q.t.
So I'm begging you, don't
Breathe a word."  "Oh, I won't.
I can keep my mouth shut...for a fee."

I had read in a travel brochure
Fifty bucks buys a full Graceland tour.
When we got there they said
It's two hundred a head.
We were gouged by those bastards for sure!

You're a noisome Northumbrian drench
Who has held there since long 'fore the French.
With a drengage your tenure
Is safe, and so then you're
A drench with a stench you can't quench.

The mad ruling's been cancelled, of course.
Ah, but even annulled it has force.
Guns no more are forbidden,
But still are kept hidden:
Trust the quashing? Consider the source.

"An excipient's used when a drug
Is too potent to take as one slug—
Which is why, in your poke,
There's more chalk than there's coke"
(Says your dealer, who thinks you're a mug).

She's expired, she's dead now, my aunt.
Feeling sorry for her? Oh, I shan't.
Caught out cheating at chess,
She created a mess,
So they killed her. Revive her? I can't.

It seems clear that the editor's role
Is constructive support, on the whole.
His comments, though biting,
Should aid better writing,
A useful and laudable goal.

If you cook in a stewpot or skillet,
And you need something starchy to fill it,
You may wish to procure a
Fine flour made from dhurra—
It's also called Indian millet.

On her countenance, everything sags,
Upper cheeks given over to bags—
Sort of wrinkled and loose.
Hubby heaps on abuse,
So, for vengeance, she ceaselessly nags.

An anagram's rather like Jumble,
Where the letters regroup and words crumble.
After all that careening
Tumbles forth a new meaning,
As in elm bust or bus melt for STUMBLE.

Though the green, to his credit, was knobbly,
His putts were consistently bobbly.
As they lurched to the flag
Like a drunk on a jag,
They were jumpy, uneven, and wobbly.

If it's raining and just won't relent
So that mold-bred conditions present
In your cellar, don't cry.
I had dampness, too. I
Filled the space with twelve loads of cement.

On the game show he wins, ever tireless;
But his prizes leave Betty desireless.
For his wife's in the know:
She's aware that her Beau
Has been given the answers by wireless.

The neighbors were playing a rhumba.
Too loud! I was hopin' for slumba.
So I called on the phone,
"Play a lullaby. (Moan.)"
All they answered was, "Sorry, wrong numba."

Polly proffers huge platters of endive:
Bitter veg into which rarely men dive.
Though that green's not a hit
For most guys, I admit
When I'm drunk into it I can then dive.

From the eggs that their mommy had spawned,
Many tadpoles hatched out in the pond.
They ate algae and grew;
Sprouted legs! Something new!
Now they're froglets, and climbing beyond.

Said a handsome young man named Alexi,
"Those lanky, lean models are sexy.
The one I like best
Has no buttocks or chest,
And her doc diagnoses cachexy."

She's used every last feminine charm
On her fancy man clamped to her arm.
Now she's feeling complete,
And he thinks that she's sweet,
But she'll bring him emotional harm.

Early on were these methods debuting.
They're biotechnological: doing
With plants such as yeast
What seemed magic, at least,
When first beer from mashed grain men were brewing.

In India, coulsonite's found
In the ore that they pull from the ground.
It's magnetite's kin,
Vanadoan, not tin.
To a steelmaking country it's bound.

The earth's trembling, and houses are cracking;
Regulations are terribly lacking.
Thanks to shale oil drilling,
Our life's become thrilling —
What the frak's going on with this fracking?

Well, I think I may say it is true,
You can see right away there's a few
Pointless words here, oh yes,
To help meter and stress.
They're called filler, gosh darn it, and whew!

A foreigner job-theft believer
Will not be a fan of Aviva.
Chomsky thinks immigration
Is good for the nation.
Is she right? Is Lou Dobbs a dumb diva?

"Let's get busy.  Hey, get off your duff,"
Said my gal, so I got in the buff;
But "start working" she'd meant.
It was not her intent
To get busy with sexual stuff.

An earth-god (or god of fertility,
Vegetation and growth, not sterility)
Would favor the crops,
Such as  wheat, nuts, and hops—
Thus enhancing our wealth and stability.

An affix: the part we remove
From, or add to, a word. Let me prove:
When surveillance is tailless,
The cops can surveil us —
By putting a tail on each move.

Instrumental (guitars, drums and keys),
Booker T. and his group, the M.G.'s,
 Shaped the southern soul sound.
Their ubiquity's found
On their own and on others' LPs.

Jim considered depositing cash,
But discovered his action was rash;
For the Grand Banks he found
Was a rich fishing ground,
And no place for a spare money splash.

The neck of a bottle goes far
As a way to make sounds on guitar.
Up and down it can slide
On the strings to provide
A glissando effect that's bizarre.

Two boxers! Just look at their size!
One's biting an ear—he's no prize!
They're both covered with bruises.
The ear biter loses.
This sure was a fight for sore guys.

John and Marsha were dating but chaste.
One dark evening John's hand was misplaced.
He started to goose her,
So Marsha, detrusor,
Threw John in a tank full of waste.

Country songs can be achingly sad,
Like the heartbreaking tale of a lad
Who gets thrown in the clink
After turning to drink
When his girl runs away with his dad.

On the table a mark, brown and round,
Where a coffee mug sat—I was bound
To admit to the cause
Of additional chores—
Just a coffee ring stain, not a mound.

When I'm angry, folks watch me, agape,
As I start to knock things out of shape.
Blow a fuse, lose my head,
Go ballistic, see red,
Lose my temper — in short, I go ape!

Speak the speech. Neither grimace nor quiver;
They're but choric, the lines you deliver.
Here description's the point.
Got your nose out of joint?
Okay, actor, then act—just a sliver.

My tall, skinny girlfriend Ophelia
Displays dolichostenomelia.
How the NBA begs
For her long arms and legs!
(With that reach she could out-Shaq O'Neal ya.)

The price of my fame?  I'm a bird
In a gilded cage.  Safe from the herd,
I'm confined where I dwell;
This huge mansion's my cell.
I'll be free when I'm dead and interred.

Two cannibals chatting: "I've seen one
Of those loud politicians—a mean one!
Ever eat one of those?"
When he asked, his friend rose
And said, "Eat one? Good lord! Ever clean one?"

Our butler was just a tad starchy.
When we asked him to chop down the larch, he
Responded: "Good sirs,
I don't do conifers!"
And his eyebrows grew terribly archy.

Said a churlish curmudgeon from Tring,
When asked for a small piece of string:
"What, you want that for free?
But that just isn't me!
Beneficence isn't my thing."

The candies are thin, and their whiteness
Suggests an aetherial lightness.
They're certainly nice,
But I peeked at the price,
And I'm feeling a little uptightness.

Later on, when depression has lifted,
And my mood has improved, I feel gifted
By some merciful deity.
From despair to tee-hee-ity
Has my view of the universe shifted.

The eating of fruit, you'll conclude,
Is frugivory. Fresh, baked or stewed,
It's a fruit plate I take,
While ignoring the steak:
Call me shrewd, this is my choice of food.

Tom addressed his concerns to the hall
Full of delegates: "Hear, one and all—
We can no longer ass kiss
Those fools in Damascus.
Get serious, tyrants must fall."

Guess I'll show all them high-brow elites —
Since it's true that you is what you eats,
Then to write verses good
I did just like I should:
Spent the week eating well-measured beets.

All day long for a strike he did pine,
Raised his hands begging God for a sign.
Straight and true, ball played well!
All ten pins finally fell!
All for naught, as he crossed the foul line.

Though at washing I'm sure I don't bungle,
My feet are becoming a jungle,
For athlete's foot grows
In between all my toes—
Could you rub in this new antifungal?

That young kitten's deformed, dysgenetic.
It can't nurse very well—how pathetic!
Its mom doesn't strive
To keep it alive.
The survivors are born energetic.

He uses both cunning and force,
And a very thick lasso, of course;
And his title of "buster
Of broncos" adds luster
To the labor of breaking a horse.

With each chapter performing in sync,
We'll dezincify, quick as a wink.
"What's the point?" you may ask,
"Of this chemical task?"
Zinc's a poisonous substance—I think.

Definitely state what you see.
Offer proof and I'm sure to agree.
You are certain, no doubt
Of what's in and what's out,
So set limits; declare "Q.E.D."

As our raft begins picking up steam,
We accelerate swiftly downstream.
When I ask our guide why,
I don't hear his reply,
Since the waterfall drowns out his scream.

My enlarger (dichroic diffuser)
Is a spirit of light, and I use her
For sacred escapes
Out of negative shapes
Into prints; when they're through, I excuse her.

"What past jobs have you had felling trees?"
"Deafforested Egypt. Huge fees!"
"Who you kidding, O'Mara?
That's desert: Sahara."
"It is now. My best feat, if you please."

You've harassed me, thus causing me grief.
From your vitriol, there's no relief.
I find need to inquire
At the source of your ire,
So, I'm asking you: please, what's your beef?

Fwoosh! It's a blast of hot air.
Fwoosh! It's a fire, I swear!
Fwoosh! No, the fizz
In my drink! Or in his?
What the — Fwoosh! No! That spray's for my hair!

For the hooker, a wave of the hand
From the dock is an age-old command.
She's directing a sailor
To shore, where he'll tail her
And study the lay of the land.

Every springtime I plant all the seeds
To grow produce my family needs.
Then I feed and I water
As much as I oughter
Just to bring up my annual weeds.

Reproduction may seem panoramic,
Its methods diverse and dynamic.
Some are rather complex,
Like selection by sex;
That's the process called apolegamic.

From the day chicken farming began,
Chicks have lived in a two-door mesh span.
They have two doors — no more,
Since a coop made with four
Would be known as a chicken sedan.

Put a half-dozen eggs in a pot.
Fill with water, turn burner to hot.
Bring to boil, wait just five
Minutes more, and then I've
Shown how splendid a cook I am—NOT!

You can try to adrenalize (spur) me,
But I'm lazy and little can stir me.
Saintly angel, you should
Know your counsel's no good,
For the sinful one's sure to deter me.

The ejusdem generis rule
(A judicial interpretive tool):
If a  broad term's behind
A list that's defined,
We limit its scope to the pool.

Using web log, I'd say, is passé.
It's replaced by just one word today.
We condensed it to 'blog,
And then went the whole hog:
The apostrophe's faded away.

I coughed and I coughed and I hacked,
Till my husband's calm countenance cracked.
"What a dreadful cacophony!
Your cough will hack off a knee!"
True!  I hacked his off, in fact.

Of green Eire I ken but a smidgin,
And in Gaelic discourse just in pidgin.
Erin's songs I adore —
So lads, let's sing one more
About whiskey or war or religion!

The word épris? The way you are feeling
When the woman next door has you reeling.
With her you're enamoured.
Your feelings have clamoured
To tell her you find her appealing!

When -acea appears in a word
As a suffix, this must be inferred:
You have animals classed
By their nature—the cast
Of Cetacea has dolphins, I've heard.

It's a fact that's established by Hubble:
We exist  on a vast cosmic bubble.
Are we specks on a froth
Of primordial broth —
Or mere lather for shaving God's stubble?

For a couple of years, D&D
Was no game, but a calling for me:
Rolling dice with ten sides,
Reading handbooks and guides,
And dispatching a kobold or three.

Egocentrism: I have that trait?
'Tis a fact: the whole world knows I'm great.
But my rep you've now slurred;
Since you're naught but a turd,
Splendid moi you can not disinflate!

If you bump into obstacles through
The course of the day with no clue
As to why your skin's color
Turns darker and duller,
Guess what? Bruises turn black and blue!

In British Columbia (B.C.):
That is where I would now like to be.
I bought my first Hoover
In downtown Vancouver,
And went on a vacuuming spree.

Hear Fred Flintstone in Daba? Go to
Southern Chad (they speak Daba); then you
Must engage in a search
For an abba in church,
And say, "Hey, abba, speak Daba—do!"

At the birth of poor Bertha, she ailed,
And no remedy tried had availed.
Baby Bertha soon died,
Bertha's father Seth cried,
And her mother, poor Willa, she wailed.

Used once in a short exclamation,
It's a cry to relieve your frustration.
"Cock's bodkins!" you shout
As you let your stress out,
Though the use of such words brings damnation.

The rock star would like us to hear
His antidrug speech, loud and clear:
"Just stay sober and clean!
(It's you kids that I mean,
Because I snort cocaine and drink beer)."

Soon after their Master ascended,
To their Creed the Apostles attended.
The three-in-one matter
Was first on their platter;
With "life everlasting" it ended.

As a ham, I give thanks in a prayer
To the F (or the Appleton) Layer,
'Cause it helps me reflect,
Though I've come to suspect
That a phone is a better conveyer.

If you're not a cartoonist, pretend:
Draw a bone. See those bumps at each end?
Those are condyles, my friend,
Found at joints that can bend,
And they slide as I flex or extend.

A catamaran I had drawn
I constructed from scratch on my lawn
From glass-fibre and plastic.
It floated—fantastic!—
Around the whole globe: Pangur Bán.

She's tenacious, my wonderful wife,
But her hobby's brought great stacks of strife:
She collects, she's fanatic.
Our basement and attic
Hold every back number of Life.

In the fall, when the weather turns coolish,
Do your kids become stubbornly mulish
In refusing to wear
Any clothes lacking flair,
So their friends won't consider them foolish?

Ruth was seeking a photo, forsooth,
So we crowded ourselves in a booth.
Since the aim was unsteady,
And Ruth wasn't ready,
Her comments got somewhat uncouth.

In the '20s, the flappers would coo
In the gin mills with saps that they'd woo.
If they found a big cheese,
They'd say, "You're the bee's knees."
And to deadbeats, just "twenty-three skidoo."

Your mother was sorry to shame ya,
But birthing you caused adynamia.
Your name's got uniqueness
For she, in her weakness,
Went nuts—so you're called "Macadamia."

Diphyodonts shed their first teeth,
They don't care—they have more underneath.
But if these rot away
After years of decay
Then my dentures I'll gladly bequeath.

Of the Garden of Eden I write:
Prelapsarian gem where two might,
Anteceding the Fall,
Have stayed pure, had it all —
Of an apple, instead, took a bite.

English phrasebooks will certainly tell us:
When you drool over something, you're jealous,
And you're lacking restraint.
Your reaction's not faint,
As your envy's unbridled and zealous.

"Collaborationist!" — cries from the crowd,
"You're a turncoat, you snake! Are you proud?
You fell under their spell;
Now you'll go straight to hell.
A red flag's gonna serve as your shroud."

As a judge, my son Edison saw
That this medicine's useful in law.
Forensic it's called,
And he's often appalled
At conclusions he finds he must draw.

To chant properly, monks, understand
This fine finger-mnemonic we've planned.
To sing ut up to fa
(Or mi–sol, or re–la),
Just recall the Guidonian hand.

So you tried to get drunk but you failed?
Just relax.  Booze can now be inhaled.
There's an alcohol spray
Like a gas, but I say
Its inventor deserves to be jailed.

A consumption tax? That's a cruel fate!
Why should folks with TB pay a — wait!
It's that money we lose
(When we buy what we use)
At a sickening, breathtaking rate.

"Stir your drink, sir?" — but James Bond demurred.
"You should know that it's shaken, not stirred!
Though it sounds rather picky,
I once stirred a Mickey,
And woke up, my vision all blurred."

Once in prison, the ex-con is now
On parole, and is proud to avow
That he works every day
And relies on his pay
For his rent and his duds and his chow.

If your wood prints are only okay,
Try to make them the Japanese way.
Carve your wood, ink it, choose
Some nice paper, then use
A good baren for great prints today.

US banknotes, for what it is worth,
Can encircle our whole planet Earth
If they're laid end-to-end.
Not just one time, my friend,
But twenty-four times 'round its girth.

Like vignette penners ain't no "vignetrists",
Novelette authors ain't "noveletrists".
Yet folks who write good —
Good as me, I guess — could
Maybe be (from belles-lettres) belletrists.

My article, "Death on Safari"—
I can't get it done till tomorry.
If I don't meet the deadline,
They'll run with this headline:
HERE'S YESTERDAY'S STORY—WE'RE SORRY!

Antikythera's given its name
To some gears and some dials that have fame
As an ancestral piece
That kept time. Athens, Greece,
Holds this treasure, its mysteries to tame.

An Aldis lamp, it is agreed by
Most sailors:  "Is just the thing we'd buy
To signal in Morse.
Not for home use, of course—
It's one hell of a nuisance to read by."

I told Nancy, "Please don't take a chance
Sporting daywear at Sam's fancy dance.
You'll be greeted with frowns
By the dames in their gowns
If you come in a tank top and pants."

"I invented a rifle — a peach.
See the rear of the barrel — the breech?
You load bullets right there,
And no gun can compare!"
"Breech of promise," said some, to my speech.

Eucalyptus leaves aren't nutritious,
And as brain food they're hardly propitious.
The koala, because he
Is stubborn and Aussie,
Will nevertheless say, "Delicious!"

I am head over heels over Fred—
My most intimate friend, so I've said;
I have overheard buzzin's
That we're cater-cousins.
No matter—we're soon to be wed.

It was calm, not a hint of a breeze
When a flaw blew in, bending the trees.
Women fled and kids cried,
Then as quickly, it died.
Maybe sometimes the sky needs to sneeze.

Corydaline, corydine: two
(Corybulbine's the third) in a brew
Homeopathists sell.
Will these alkaloids quell
The abdominal pain from my flu?

"This 'weapons for hostages' myth?
Let us put it behind us forthwith.
Colonel Oliver North,
Let us hear you. Come forth."
(But he tripped on the rug and came fifth.)

Counterprogramming's common today,
Being used to lure viewers away
From a rival's hit show
To a program that's so
Doggone good it will get them to stay.

As laptops get cuter and cuter,
I'll opt for a female computer.
Choose a male one? No way—
That's disturbingly gay.
(And she'll climax each time I re-boot 'er.)

The accusative absolute — what
Makes my students believe it's just rot?
Them being so dense,
Grammar doesn't make sense
To this under-achieving spoilt lot.

When poor Einstein could not get to sleep,
He would try to count relative sheep,
But they wouldn't stand still
In his visions until
He taught them his new quantum leap.

To divide up an apple and pear
So that everyone garnered her share?
We were quite at a loss
'Til we cooked them as sauce,
Yielding portions impeccably fair.

Your business will likely succeed
If your firm is efficient. Indeed,
If you have quite enough,
Toss the duplicative stuff;
They're the copies you don't really need.

A disease with results that are tragic,
Black measles (it's called  hemorrhagic),
Has no treatment or cure,
But what's more, and for sure,
Vaccination prevents it—like magic!

The east fork's what waters Mike's lea,
While the west fork keeps Peter's parch-free.
But my creek's just a trickle
And I'm caught in a pickle—
Should I corrivate both towards me?

There's a star called "the back of the Bear"
Which is almost the brightest one there.
Dubhe's typical role
Is to point at the pole;
It's a cinch, 'cause it's part of a pair.

Their romantic encounter: sublime,
But her partner turns out to be slime,
For he tells all his friends
That he banged her, which ends
Their once budding affair—what a crime!

In two-thousand-and-four we began
The OEDILF's brobdingnagian plan:
To define every word
With a limerick. Absurd?
It's our Anapest Destiny, man!

Your deploredness ranks as severe;
I recoil from your state way up here,
Where I sit on my steed.
You are wretched indeed
And of succor in need; that is clear.

My mom had a penchant linguistic,
For short witty maxims simplistic.
She'd serve up a sermon
In tones like Ms. Merman,
In one single phrase aphoristic.

My chapbook is tiny and wee;
A bookish chap sold it to me.
My thighs I doth slap
At its verses and crap—
Like this limerick, good chap. Tee-hee-hee!

"Once documents hung on a string,
Or a wire, for quick access. They'd swing,
But weren't big, messy piles.
The strings were called files."
"From the Latin for thread?" "Got it! Ding!"

It's a fruit that is named for the shapes
Of its clusters, resembling huge grapes.
Its size also suggests
A woman's large breasts,
Which you'll see if her robe she undrapes.

A drop letter, put in the mail,
In the post office lands without fail.
Then it sits on a shelf;
You retrieve it yourself
(Though you won't have to pay any bail).

I'm frustrated and bored on this ship,
Out at sea with no specimens — zip!
And that rig-swinging crew —
They're like apes in a zoo!
I fear nothing will come of this trip.

They're baby-makers: father and mother —
Two humans creating another
Via egg implantation
Or male penetration;
They're parents, one way or the other.

An art form means jazz or ballet,
Or pottery made out of clay,
Or fictional tomes,
Or paintings or poems,
Or crafting the perfect toupee.

Nine lenkviches lernink zo fast
Zat I movink to head uff ze clast.
Ya, ze Svedish, ze Dutch,
Iss mein accent too much,
But ze English I spikkink ze bast!

My new volume with foldouts of Rome
Is unwieldy and craves its own home.
Normal size is exceeded;
A book cradle's needed
For display and to page through this tome.

With real fervor in church, some will bawl it:
"AMEN!" For no reason, they squall it.
But they quiet right down
When the plate comes around,
And pretend that they don't have a wallet.

As we sat in the bistro and dined
And drank wine, I'd relax and unwind,
But the more that I'd drink,
The less I could think,
Until nothing at all came to mind.

My limerick has me distraught.
Line four's where I start to get caught
In a paradox vile:
Line five is true, while
Line four, above-mentioned, is not.

When you tell me, my friend, you congree,
Or agree, then I hope it's with me!
But if problems arise
And you don't put me wise,
I just might not congree then with thee.

The bran flakes are limp as can be,
And the wheat puffs are soggy debris.
So I'm wondering, "Why
(With a small slice of wry)
Does a cereal killer run free?"

Though I wanted so badly to win,
By the end I was wholly done in.
April slammed down the card
On the table real hard
And went out with a grin shouting, "Gin!"

At the gas station, patrons feel screwed;
As the prices increase, they get rude.
So they rant and they curse
As each gallon gets worse.
(People over a barrel get crude.)

He had cucumber sandwiches made
For his aunt, but proceeded to wade
Through the whole bloomin' stack,
Leaving none for poor Jack
Or his aunt, Lady Bracknell, who brayed . . .

You take steroids?  Well, that's your affair.
Steroid acne's a threat, so beware.
Will your muscles be hits
If they're covered in zits?
(On the plus side, though, blackheads are rare.)

You're not sure, so you only can guess
Where to find out the story of Bes.
You might ask a mythologist,
But a good Egyptologist
Can tell you the facts—more or less.

Kurt adores her as much as can be,
But when Kate makes her usual plea,
His emotions will bifurcate:
Quite willing to die for Kate /
Unwilling to shave his goatee.

"Which weighs more, twenty pounds — answer this —
Of light feathers, or dark chocolate (Swiss)?"
At last he responded
(He'd puzzled and pondered),
"I'll guess: equiponderant, Miss?"

Leaving lands where one church was trustee
For all souls, they said, "Let us agree.
No one denomination
Shall hold our salvation:
All beliefs (even dis-) shall be free."

At the fair, men line up for a buss
From a beauty, who's causing the fuss.
Her good looks light the room,
And their lust's in full bloom,
But her skunky breath makes kissers cuss.

Pre-eclampsia seems pretty rough,
But eclampsia really is tough.
Your BP's so high
You'll have fits, and may die—
Isn't just giving birth bad enough?

You went digging for gold, which you struck.
Now you're posh, thanks to cunning and luck.
With your airs and your graces
You've covered your traces,
But we know you're common as muck.

Said the soldier on guard at his station,
"I am proud to be serving my nation,
But I'd rather be home,
Plowing rows of dark loam,
So I pray for demilitarization."

"I'm not balding!" my father once said.
"There's still hair growing thick on my head.
It is just that my mop
Has escaped from the top —
I've a surfeit of ear hair instead."

Abenteric's a term that, with tact,
Says disease or infection, in fact,
Can be found where, of course,
It's away from its source
In the gastrointestinal tract.

The boundaries of logic I'll push
As I sit here at home on my tush:
If I hold half a bird
In my hand, it's inferred
That it's equal to one in the bush.

King Arthur is looking askance;
Guinevere cannot sit — see her dance
Wild and fast to the beat,
Now she's feeling the heat
Of a boil that should meet with a Lance.

Alpaca's a restaurant meat;
In Peru, it's considered a treat.
A bit gamy, like deer,
It goes best with a beer—
Inca Cola's a little too sweet.

For soothing, no drug can surpass
Analgesics (the pain-killing class).
Two aspirins will do
To relieve aches from flu,
But they won't cure a pain in the ass.

My sister complained rather queasily,
"I'm not sure why you're grinning so cheesily.
That huge Tilt-A-Whirl
Is what caused me to hurl—
It could have been you rather easily."

"Kids, thanks for the card.  Tell your mother
Today I go choreless."  "Oh, brother!
I heard that!  This one day
In June, the third Sunday,
For you is just like any other!"

My husband cajoles me and eggs
Me to change my appearance; he begs
And blandanders each day.
Dear Ann Landers, please say
It's okay to have hair on my legs!

All our structures are made of fascines
Set in place without help from machines.
Since we can't afford bricks,
We use bundles of sticks.
Our expenses comport with our means.

A flirtation is fun as a test
Of appeal, but soon gone is its zest.
An affair cruelly dies
When the cuckold gets wise,
So a dalliance suits me the best.

"Die, tumors!" we cry. Apoptosis,
We love ya, and tumor necrosis
Is great. But this factor
Can be a bad actor —
I've an autoimmune diagnosis.

When the painter arrived—he's no slouch—
A large drop cloth he threw on the couch
To protect it from splatter.
Dad was mad as a hatter.
"But I nap there!" he cried—what a grouch!

It's curtains for Sal; he was caught
With his nose in the president's plot.
The report mentions treason,
And that is the reason
Sal's prospects aren't looking so hot.

In the physico-chemical field,
By theory and practice revealed:
Some important reactions
Produce but small fractions—
Equilibrium limits their yield.

Filled with love, I had planned in advance
That I'd ask my new beau for a dance.
"Oh, I'm sorry, my dear,
The dance orchestra's here.
I'm conducting, and can't change my stance."

Was Butch Cassidy fierce and inhuman?
Some declare he was shy, unassumin',
And friendly, and yet
It's a pretty sure bet
He did not look at all like Paul Newman.

In Flatbush, the Lords led the way
At the cheerleading contest one day,
From the baron of "rah"
Through the duke of "huzzah"
To the prize-winning oil of "olé."

Here's a musical horse-riding riddle:
What straddles both saddle and fiddle?
A bow: with a string,
It makes violins sing,
And gives shape where you sit in the middle.

When a mark is of certification,
It signifies strict conformation
To standards or rules.
Don't be suffering fools
Without papers or documentation.

Right on Interstate 495,
Alligators will eat you alive.
They're just soaking up sun.
Should you run over one
You might find it a challenge to drive.

That life somehow once overcame
Surly bonds, and without taking aim
Crossed the void and arrived
Somewhere else and survived,
Is ballistic panspermia's claim.

The astronomer working tonight
Will act meek and polite while it's bright,
But when nighttime holds sway
And he works at coudé,
He will elbow his way to the light.

If he injured his forearm , Sylvester
Might develop a wound that would fester.
Such exulceration
Might cause consternation
At work: he's the monarch's court jester.

When he paid his devoirs to the Queen
The Marine was told, "Please keep it clean."
But he let rip a fart,
Which was not at all smart;
Now his duties are in the latrine.

Far-flung from the summer's sweet blossom
Hides autumn, curled up like a possum.
And through winter's cold jeer,
We still hope for spring's cheer,
So enjoy, for now, leaves that are awesome.

I your horse-sense, Ms. Hortense, distrust,
And I'm saddled with loser's disgust!
I say "Nay!" — no more feed
For these nags that we breed.
I'm disgruntled, fed up! We'll go bust!

As they buzz round the blossoms with ease,
They seem friendly and eager to please,
But we've seen more aggression
With each year's succession:
The Africanization of bees.

It was fast, such a frightening surprise,
As I saw the ball suddenly rise.
So I ducked to the floor.
It continued to soar
Past the 'keeper's head. We won on byes.

See this rash? It is itchy and red.
"An acute drug eruption," Doc said,
"From your new asthma pill
That has made you feel ill.
Use this handy inhaler instead!"

This winter, for more than a week, a
Vacation I'll probably seek—a
Good climate, white beaches,
And high mountain reaches.
I'll find them in sweet Costa Rica.

You've two girls on the line. It gets late
While you choose whom to date as I wait.
Jill's smart (but she's snooty);
Jane's dumb (but what booty!).
It's time that you fish or cut bait!

When you're chasing the dragon, it's true
You can die from the high you pursue.
Fight its fiery breath,
For the dragon is death.
Slay it first, or the dragon slays you.

"You heard 'bears on the battlefield,' Chet?"
And my buddy said, "Yeah, but not yet.
I have heard it's been planned
That a robot, unmanned,
Will give rides like you'll never forget!"

When in Yorkshire, one phrase you may hear
Is "a near", which sounds quite like "an ear".
While the latter's for hearing,
The former's for clearing
One's blood, making urine appear.

The story of Banting and Best?
Their experiments, made with great zest,
Came from people's entreaties
To cure diabetes;
And insulin came from that quest.

As Lord Byron versed Canto the First,
He drank wine to immerse his great thirst.
Thus, before he had mastered
The Third, he was plastered,
Though Canto the Fourth was the worst.

The transitive verb to adduce
Has a really tight meaning (not loose).
Use "discern" or "determine,"
You show lack of learnin';
Adduce — "give as reasons or proofs."

The conchfish is small, but he's shrewd.
In his mouth Papa shelters his brood.
With a conch he will stay,
Neath its mantle, by day;
When it's dark, he goes hunting for food.

I look chrysalid up, and I find
It means "pupal," but never the kind
In the eye that can gaze.
It's a butterfly's phase—
One that's left larval living behind.

Behold our Thanksgiving Day fare!
Such a foison of dishes we'll share—
Far too many to list,
But you guys get the gist.
Now let's eat! Hurry up with that prayer!

He will take off his gloves on the Hill,
Fighting bare-knuckle battles with skill.
Unrelenting and fierce
Is Republican Pierce:
Pulling punches is not on the bill.

Mr. Asimov's demon Azazel
Had magical powers that dazzle,
But now that God's dead
He just mopes in his bed,
Drinking coffee and flicking through Razzle.

The people of interest to me?
Unbowed émigrés, those forced to flee.
By those tough ones I'm fascinated:
Uprooted — deracinated —
Like Dad, a bereft refugee.

You did what? Well, I think you've been had.
Bought a weed for the garden? You're mad.
Oh, brook thistle, red bloom?
That's unique, I assume;
It sounds radical — could start a fad.

Astrophysics is physics in space,
And from quarks to big branes, it's a race
To explain all this stuff,
But the going gets tough
When Steve Hawking is setting the pace.

I quit college without an apology;
I haven't a head for technology.
I got screaming abdabs
From the chemistry labs,
Heebie-jeebies from reading biology.

All my photos are facing abortion
Due to chromatism (color distortion)
In the lens that I use.
It's affecting the hues,
Though the subject's in perfect proportion.

What can be said that's consoling
When pain is an ocean wave rolling
And grief is the shore?
What can soothe a heart sore
With a sorrow beyond its controlling?

My mother was one of the ones
That the ministers, vicars, and nuns
Might have sought, as their goal,
To increase the church roll —
But the reason she went was the buns.

When my photos were up on the wall,
Exhibited, someone would call,
"They are just black-and-white!"
My reaction then might
Be, "I'm colour-blind, fellow, that's all!"

Said the ad: "BBW." Great!
A "big, beautiful woman" to date.
I'm not doubting her gender
Or the fact she's not slender,
But that middle word's up for debate.

The market that's wildest by far
Is the famed Oriental bazaar.
On its shop-lined packed street
Are bizarre finds that treat
Bargain hunters to goods without par.

The apple's a dangerous fruit.
Whether Eve ate an apple is moot,
But as for Snow White,
Who took one tiny bite,
Downing apples was hardly astute.

A. G. Bell, an inventor who would
Change the world, made himself understood.
His words from one room
Through the wire went zoom
Out to Watson who heard them.  He could!

The designer's collection's his best.
Now each model will strut with the rest.
Down the catwalk, the shoes
Entertain and amuse
In what's seen as a high-fashion fest.

Columbus, alas! set the pattern:
On the New World the Old World would batten.
With no Santa Maria
We wouldn't be here,
And the Indians would still have Manhattan.

The prefixes crypto- and crypt-
Are both signals your lips must be zipped.
There's a secret we've hidden,
Disclosure's forbidden,
And people who blab will be whipped.

"Ironmonger" it says, I'll allow,
But my sign I will soon disavow.
To my shop people march:
"Take my shirts—heavy starch!"
I prefer the old "feroner" now.

He sold snake oil with glib peroration;
Left us sick, broke, and full of frustration.
Now he's feathered and tarred,
And he cries out, "It's hard
And unjust, this bituminization!"

Chrysothamnus nauseosus provides
Desert growth where the jackrabbit hides.
It can grow to three feet;
Its aroma is sweet,
But it's quite nasty tasting, besides.

This intriguer is overly eager
To become a big wheel—major leaguer.
He's campaigning too hard
And he'll never be starred,
As his output's, at best, rather meager.

I bought dill from the snowy Ukraine,
And some saffron from sun-blistered Spain,
But they're quite an expense;
Now I haven't the cents
For the cumin from outer Lorraine.

Here's a stand-off: to use the word flaccid,
One camp flabbily rhymes it with acid;
While the rival camp acts
As though FLAX- fits the facts.
In this flux, take a stab; no one's placid.

Colonialists have ambitions
To settle and farm acquisitions.
The tongue of their motherland,
Set in some other land,
Varies with local conditions.

How to name the unspeakable? Can
Atrocious describe all that man
Has inflicted on others—
Even babies and  mothers?
Does it hint at barbarity's span?

Among Cleopatra's great bennies
Was the stabling of hundreds of jennies.
Cleo's ass was like silk
'Cause she bathed in their milk.
(I get donkey-milk gel masks at Penney's.)

It's one of those moments in time
That verges upon the sublime:
You are high on a hill,
All alone, and quite still…
Then the bells of a church start to chime.

I went to see Reverend Nathaniel
With my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel,
But the dog is a smelly 'un
And acted Cromwellian
By devouring the whole Book of Daniel.

As a researcher for a new book,
A long trip to Südengland I took
As a caricaturist-
cum-business tourist
I drew (and at night learnt to cook).

A biologist?  No, I am not.
I make puns, and I will 'til I rot.
I love language erotic
And eukaryotic,
Like alga and algae, a lot.

My friend Tinker Bell can't help but drink.
So eupeptic, was I  — tickled pink  —
When she stayed on the wagon
And off of the flagon:
Two shot-glasses? One pickled Tink.

Fetch your father, my boy, but don't dally.
Lurking footpads await in each alley.
They'd confront you, or, worse,
Slit your neck for your purse.
God forbid you face such a finale!

Any anagram features the same
Set of letters to form a new frame.
Like the gods' mother Rhea,
Whose last daughter would be a
Young Hera. Now that's a cool name.

Ever notice that growth of a vine
Won't proceed in a perfect straight line?
It's the tip's inclination
To circumnutation
That causes a tendril to twine.

Orthopedics? I swear, nothing to it!
Their school? It's a snap to get through it.
On the job, here's the buzz:
They're called cavemen because
It's so easy a caveman could do it.

In my hammock my mood was irenic.
I felt languorous, oddly asthenic,
And alone, so I thought,
Till the breeze gently brought
An aroma I knew biogenic.

You've got four stomachs, cow. In the last,
True digestion occurs unsurpassed.
Abomasal's the word
For all actions past third
In your tummy arrangement so vast.

He was reared in a seamy bordello;
His skin's a diseased shade of yellow.
Rather worn and unclean
For a lad of eighteen,
He's in less than fine fettle, this fellow.

Simon Boccanegra: it's got
A meandering, serpentine plot,
But five lines?—not enough
To explain all that stuff—
Just believe me; you'll like it a lot.

An Arabic farmland awaits
In the smallest of UAE states.
It's Ajman on the coast
Of the Persian Gulf. Most
Of its exports are gas, fish and dates.

Gertrude Ederle, weary and cold,
Swam the Channel at 20 years old.
Said the first English greeter
Who'd gone out to meet her,
"Where's your passport?" (...or so we are told.)

Everlastingness means there's no end
To an action or state. Comprehend?
If by chance it's infernal,
Then what price eternal?
This prospect is dreadful, my friend.

William Calley, Lieutenant, was shy—
Not a blood-thirsty, war-hungry guy.
Those who met him, do they
Still recall him today?
Ask the Vietnamese of My Lai.

The computer code writers proclaim,
"This A.I.'s solved the old checkers game."
I fear one day we'll find
It's jumped over Mankind,
And said, "Crown me! King A.I.'s my name."

Order things in a set so, when done,
They will all correspond, one to one,
With the numbers we use
When we count. What ensues?
Countability! Math is such fun!

I laugh at all those who said Trump
Had no path to 270.  Dump
The pre-polling, I say.
When it counted, the day
That it mattered, he kicked Clinton's rump.

A bleach-out's a nifty technique:
Take a photo that's printed real weak,
Then just draw over top
With your pen.  When you stop,
Bleach the pic, keep the drawing—très chic!

Al-Buraq was Mohammed's winged steed
And enabled the prophet, with speed,
To fly to the Gate
And there meet his fate
To embrace the great faith he would lead.

He's complained about food since age two—
Takes a bite, then he'll fussily chew;
Says, "l don't like the taste."
But today I've been graced
'Cause he's yours, as you just said, "I do."

Yes, cultural diversity's why
I live where I live, because I
Love all ethnic cuisines:
Tacos, pho, collard greens,
Paprikash, vindaloo, tom yum gai ...

Our center, a lummox named Kline,
Has been yanked (he's now riding the pine.)
He can block shots, rebound,
But his shooting's not sound,
And he chokes  at the charity line.

Tomorrow's my sweet baby's bris.
(That foreskin he'll surely not miss.)
The mohel'll be snipping;
My boy'll be yipping...
I'll give him a hug and a kiss.

Harold Bird, OBE (known as "Dickie"),
As a cricketing umpire was quick. He
Was one of the best
When faced with a Test,
Though his way with "How's that?" could be tricky.

A sinner knelt down for confession
That turned into an extra long session.
The detailed love feast
That was told to the priest
Won a trophy for sexual transgression!

"The cornerstone," Harry has said,
"Of my wealth is the life I have led."
But the truth is there's more
To this tale. At the core
Lies his super-rich uncle (now dead).

A thief with a long ugly knife
Stole my credit card—changed my whole life.
"What a shock!" (That's my niece.)
"Did you call the police?"
"No, he's charging much less than my wife!"

An Essex girl finds it's a strain
When expected to challenge her brain.
So, please understand
That her coffee break's banned.
She would take far too long to retrain!

Should you happen to stir up a hive,
Your sharp mind will so neatly arrive
At an action plan clear
(An effect of pure fear)
Which consists of feet moving belive.

Said the doc to my overwrought missus,
"False pregnancy, that is what this is.
One can't get with child
From a love life that's mild,
Comprising just pats, hugs and kisses!"

Your betrothed was exposed to your classlessness
When you crassly made fun of her asslessness.
She's completely enraged;
You're no longer engaged;
And you're desolate, mourning your lasslessness.

The Equidae family, of course,
Has as members the ass and the horse.
As to which is the badder,
I've been told it's the latter,
Which comes straight from the mouth of my source.

"I'm invisible now; see ya later,"
Said the cheeselip (a sowbug or slater)
As it rolled in a ball.
In the North, what we call
Cheeselip's rennet, the big cheese creator.

Strong sheep-dip's a liquid that serves
To a flea what that vermin deserves,
Which is death (though Bo Peep
And her immature sheep
Risk demyelination of nerves).

Hear the drummers and pipers in bands,
Who transmit the commander's commands,
While the buglers amass,
Blaring orders with class—
Brassy patterns each troop understands.

She's adorned "Fearless Leader" today,
In a novel and interesting way.
  She'll be stripped to the waist,
  And then covered in paste,
Then we'll roll her about in the hay.

A willow bark vendor named Steve
Had a pain he aspired to relieve.
Now he's drawn his last breath—
Sad to say—bled to death
On a splinter of bark, I believe.

"Done and dusted!" I said when the deal
Was concluded.  They're happy, but we'll
Not sell gems any more
To that fine jewelry store.
They'll soon learn they bought fakes — they ain't real.

Overstaying his welcome, a pest
Of a parasite, getting me stressed,
Was sent packing.  "Goodbye
And good riddance," said I
As my bum of a son left the nest.

A Canuck known as Sass, with his son,
Fished the river 'til daylight was done.
It was easy to see
That his son had caught three,
But no one saw Saskatchewan.

The monk in contemplative prayer
Fought his demons of doubt and despair,
And in wordless communion
Sought mystical union
And faith in a peace he could share.

The motorist braked with a honk
And his nose hit the dash with a conk.
Both the sound that he made
And the bump (in a shade
Of chartreuse) on his nose was a bonk.

"You're a hairy, ill-mannered buffoon.
I'd suggest you try changing your tune."
"Your candor's impressive.
I may seem excessive,
But my bearishness makes women swoon."

When young Dick Urry ran out of stock
To build timber piers strong as a rock.
He decided to try
A new wood. My, oh my!
Come see Dick Urry's hickory dock.

A baby, so small and unique,
Is strong, though its body is weak.
It compels what you do
With its food, clothes, and poo,
Not to mention the nappies that leak.

As she enters the big change of life,
Her estrogen's no longer rife.
So she suffers hot flashes
And mood swings and crashes.
Can hormone pills fend off her strife?

A belle had to make a selection:
Evade or attract the detection
Of moles on her face.
A delight or disgrace?
Beauty patches enhanced imperfection.

Egypt's president Gamal A. Nasser sighs,
"Your mural, you mule with the ass's eyes,
Is modern, not classic,
And your Nile looks thalassic!
Now repaint it, Muhammad — and classicize!"

When a substance is called deliquescent,
It's solid and when moisture's present,
Sucks all it can get
And so makes itself wet.
If it's on you, that isn't so pleasant.

Pompous  Caiaphas, Jewish High Priest:
Ancient Christians thought he was a beast,
Since he said that our Lord
Should be killed, not adored,
While they thought he should be released.

The studios jumped to espouse
"Fill the theater" — and not just the house.
Wide-screen Cinemascope
Gave the filmmakers hope —
More exposure for Marilyn's blouse.

Is your nation engulfed in deep trouble?
Though you'll risk quick reduction to rubble,
I can offer this cure
(It's the new curse du jour) —
May the West bring you aid on the double.

Four roads formed a carfax where I
Stood and wondered, "Which way?", with a sigh.
So I asked Mr Frost,
Who was equally lost.
He said, "Take the one least travelled by."

"Am I blue? Am I blue? Ain't these tears
In my eyes tellin' you?" It appears
Yes indeed, that's your hue.
Cyanometer: True!
(So's your mood, as you're stewed on ten beers.)

A chocolate soldier is one
Who is peaceful when all's said and done.
To no combat assigned,
Not at all do I mind.
Let me carry a tune, not a gun.

This is cultic behavior you're showing—
That tail and those horns that you're growing.
Go ahead, join a cult,
But beware the result:
Any chance to be saved you'll be blowing.

When I notice this sexy young skirt,
I act charming, I smile, and I flirt.
She replies with a blunt
Brusquerie, and I grunt;
I feel hurt when a skirt is so curt.

A whinny from Winnie the Horse
Is a verse we're averse to endorse,
As her meter and rhyme
Fail to scan half the time.
Does she versify? Nay. Neigh, of course.

Oh, Ludwig van Beethoven, you
Shook up music much more than you knew.
Mozart, Haydn, first-rate —
No one carried their weight
Till Eroica's downbeat crashed through!

Find the stocks that advanced—call them A;
Then there's D's for declines (price decay).
Graph the A to D slope,
Predicting, you hope,
How the markets will move and which way.

This plume on my rear's an affliction,
It's not just an artist's depiction.
I've tugged and I've scratched,
But it's firmly attached.
Now you dare say my tale is affixion?!

Saw your ad — so you're "Man-with-a-Van"!
If I book you, then this is the plan:
I will lob in the brick,
Grab the gold, and then, quick,
You must drive like the clappers, my man!

Does this word start with 'I' (as I think) or 'E'?"
The Yank asked the Brit. "That's my inquiry"—
"Either spell it with 'I' or 'E';
Say, though, 'enquiry'
(Not that I'd kick up a stinkery)."

Since his vision's completely daltonic,
Blood and ordure, like grass, seem harmonic.
To undo this utopia
(Due to deuteranopia)
Would make him see green. How ironic!

When I say that he gave me a look
That was funny, I can't say I shook
With laughter and grinned.
He looked strangely, "eyes skinned",
As if checking me out as a crook.

In the hall right outside where they play,
We heard grandmasters bragging all day.
They were asked to disband
Because no one could stand
Chess-nuts boasting in an open foyer.

The Corypha genus is small,
But its fan palms are typically tall.
Once these plants bear their fruit,
It's the end of the route,
Since they die (and eventually fall).

The skydiver's mother had bawled
At the sight of her son lying sprawled,
Body broken, face cut.
He had bounced. (That is what
Unsurvivable landings are called.)

We have suffered delays in the past
And our backlog has always amassed.
Now our schedule's designed
To avoid any bind
In production; the fail-safes are vast.

My work's chromosomal: with genes.
Using cutting-edge technical means,
I adjust DNA
In my lab every day
With synthetic genetic routines.

"That smell is horrendous."  "Yes.  Quite."
"You're to blame."  "Absolutely.  You're right.
That's a fact.  No disputin'.
For certain.  Darn tootin'.
Those beans have me tootin' all night."

The effects of his job are severest
At home, on his nearest and dearest.
Careering away
In his workaweek day,
Is the fate of the lonely careerist.

Poor old Pop's equilibrium's shot;
He's unstable, more often than not.
So he sways side to side
And he clings to his pride
As he pisses… and misses the pot.

Watch the best at the Brickyard and learn
How to corner — perform a tight turn.
They manage the curves,
Seldom skidding, no swerves,
Well deserving the winnings they earn.

Viagra, so says my adviser,
Is sildenafil, trademarked by Pfizer.
The blue diamonds I'm fed
Mean I'm longer in bed,
Though I'm lately the earliest riser.

At the dew point the vapour condenses
From the air, and a dewfall commences.
As the temperature falls,
Ageing poet recalls
Barefoot walks through wet stalks — sharpened senses.

Since our forebears arrived on these shores,
Many millions have flocked to our stores.
On-line shopping's destroyed us.
The youngsters avoid us.
It's over: we're closing our doors.

Does the strip with school janitor Frazz
Have some mystery to it? It has!
Many Frazz fans believe
Just one man can achieve
Such fine Calvin and Hobbes-like pizzazz.

At the fairgrounds, they'll charge you a penny
For a whirl on a wild flying jenny.
Threats of mishap aside,
It's a child-thrilling ride—
A perennial highlight for many.

Cresses flourish on lowlands and plains,
And in snow atop steep mountain chains.
The chamois cress flowers
In chill alpine showers;
More temperate climes it disdains.

I bring you a cake to divide,
But you cut several pieces too wide.
Then you villainous bums
Leave me nothing but crumbs.
Where's my chance to be first to decide?

To her nest a young eagle from Clare
Invited a stork from Kildare.
They frolicked, quite wary
To not tip her aerie.
It's a long way to fall through thin air.

Some criminals sent to the pillory
Had maintained an illegal distillery,
Or were sentenced for muggery,
Thuggery, buggery,
Stealing the guv'nor's artillery.

The cheese-maker's daughter, Carlotta,
Said, "Anari is much like ricotta.
It's a mild cheese, a whey cheese,
A Dad's-made-my-day cheese.
Come and try a taste. Oh, you just gotta!"

His dauntlessness proves he has heart,
And his bravery sets him apart.
People call him a hero;
To me he's a zero.
His ego is way off the chart.

Gorgonzola — with flavor it's rife.
It's the best cheese I've had in my life,
But that greenish-blue veining
Keeps some folks abstaining.
It's better not served to my wife.

The deodar, one kind of cedar,
Is large; among trees it's a leader.
In high mountains it's met,
In Nepal and Tibet,
Far away, I regret, my dear reader!

Damn near perfect again, in control;
In the back of the net, my third goal.
One more game ball is mine;
They should build me a shrine.
The small price? My degenerate soul.

"When a leaf is canescent, it reaches
Pubescence," a botanist teaches
His students, "And there's
A new growth of fine hairs
(Grayish white), like the fuzz on our peaches."

American Gothic is good.
It's a painting by Mr. Grant Wood.
In the fourground it has
Two old farmer types as
Out in front of their farmhouse they stood.

A big snake has me wrapped in its grasp.
(Take a guess — anaconda or asp?)
It's my life's latest hurdle —
I can't disengirdle
My body. There goes my last ga—

We were hunting the old Hindu Kush,
As our beaters tried vainly to flush
Out a tiger espied
In the bush by our guide,
Who kept beating about in the brush.

Belly buttons are nature's reward,
Marking Mother's umbilical cord.
There are outies and innies
That mystics and ninnies
Can gaze at whenever they're bored.

It's crib time, so what's in our bags?
Cut lunches with sammos and snags.
That'll do, so we grin,
'Cause it's time to bog in,
Have a yack and then hand round the fags.

Our heroine followed the route
Of the water-park's slippery chute
But her top got untied
And then washed down the slide.
Thus bare-breasted, our Sue followed suit.

This drug was used widely before
There were findings docs couldn't ignore.
It was thought less addictive,
But that theory was fictive;
Not much Demerol's sold anymore.

Since the chill in my bones has increased,
An amount of heat must be released.
And I'm now quite specific:
This fire, calorific,
Has value — my coldness has ceased.

"Are you up yet? Get moving, now! Joh-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-hn?"
I can not beat this drowsiness... (yaw-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-wn!)
While awake, I'm a flake,
But in dreams I can make
Any woman my own. I'm Don Jua-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-an....          (...zzzzz)

Your mother's a lifelong subscriber
To the cult that loves dietary fiber,
So don't  cry and sulk;
Eat your roughage and bulk.
That works better than money to bribe 'er.

The contraction spelled ain't means "am not"
Or "do not" or "does not" or "did not"
Or "are not" or "is not"
Or "have not" or "has not,"
Which means ain't is tied up in a knot.

Yellow hollandaise sauce, an emulsion,
If it breaks, will elicit revulsion
(There's a layer of fat —
Only fools would eat that!)
And from Cordon Bleu college, expulsion.

Buffalo buffalo buffalo.
Buffalo buffalo buffalo.
Buffalo buffalo
Buffalo buffalo
Buffalo Buffalo buffalo.

Bambini are yearlings or tots,
And we smiles when we sees them a lots;
But they leaves us aghast,
Ever growing too fast.
Soon they're teens, and we just wants to plotz.

The brown bavian (chacma) baboon
Walks about in a primate platoon.
It does oodles of harm
To the crops on a farm
(Whether corporate, or village commune).

A camorra's a secret society
Which is known for its evil, not piety.
But write it Camorra
(And don your fedora)
And you mean the Italian variety.

While an artichoke stuffed may be nice,
To prepare it you'll need a device
To help scoop out the choke,
And the task may provoke
A real need for a tool that's precise.

Think of father-lasher; do you then wish
You could flagellate Dad with a swish?
Before aiming to maim,
Be aware it's the name
Of a sculpin—a tail-thrashing fish.

"Acromicria," so the vet said,
And the concept just filled me with dread.
For the growth of the limbs
Of my puppy, hope dims,
And it sometimes refers to the head!

There's this pregnant and overstuffed cell
Who has lately been feeling unwell.
As her final decision,
She opts for division.
The rest is too gruesome to tell!

Clem, I swear that it's hotter than hell!
Let's sit down in a black spot a spell.
The shade from that tree
Looks invitin' to me,
An' our horses could use it as well.

At assemblies, our Principal Wang
Always gives such a boring harangue.
But today it was culminated
When a cherry bomb fulminated,
Thus ending his talk with a bang!

While hiking the forest with Lee,
I noted a tall, stately tree.
Lee's comment: "A pine."
"No, broad-leafed," was mine.
"It's angiospermous, you see."

What's a didact? A person whose tactic
When speaking of, say, chiropractic,
Is unduly specific
And turns soporific.
He's preachy and dull—he's didactic.

I can wear sexy clothes that not many fit
Since I've kept myself trim and I'm plenty fit,
But you've got me all wrong
When you buy me a thong.
I'm not wearing that thing for your benefit!

I'm carsick and more than unhappy.
This sinuous road is just crappy.
As you screech round rough peaks
(Craggy mounts), I curb shrieks.
Damn straight I'm anfractuous (snappy).

In the chorus, cast off to one side;
In the back, just along for the ride;
And left standing in hallways,
Alas, I am always
A bridesmaid, but never the bride.

A denumerably infinite set
Can be counted? In theory, no sweat!
All the rationals, hon,
Correspond one-to-one
To the integers. How? I forget.

To follow his chosen vocation,
He canvassed each school in the nation.
To become a tycoon,
He found Wharton a boon;
There he's studying business administration.

Cuban crocodiles, smallest of crocs,
Though endangered, are smart as a fox.
They're quite beautiful, yet
They are not ones to pet,
Since they'll eat you right down to your socks.

I drill oil.  "Let's go dig us a well!"
But the wellbore? "Too narrow!" I yell.
Pouring acid might open
That borehole.  "Here's hopin'
This rock's acidizable.  ...Hell!"

In the lim-writing, workshopping games,
Some work will get shot down in flames
Because you went along
With consistently wrong
Sugs from — oops. (I will mention no names.)

No simp here, she forges ahead.
Wimps will cave, but she'll stand tough instead.
Can't be took, she's a fighter;
Take care not to slight her.
She's got balls, and especially in bed.

They had painted the famed Monticello
Snowy white, but it's turning to yellow.
That bilging white paint
Made a home that was quaint
Look run-down, like a seedy bordello.

In the forest, in Queensland, at night,
Be alert for a seldom seen sight.
It's a tree kangaroo
Called a boongary—you
Likely won't catch a glimpse.  But you might.

Why, you con-artist phony (political)!
You fudged your analysis (critical).
Your slick greedy ways'll
Corrupt your appraisal,
You son of a bitch (parasitical)!

"Let's drop nets with a keen expectation
Of finding our favorite crustacean,"
Young Tim, uttered gabbily.
Old Tom muttered, crabbily,
"And hope that our net's not frustration."

Do you find yourself talking like this?
Are your family and friends getting pissed?
Could it be any worse
When you're thinking in verse?
Mister Anapest, cease and desist!

Farming and cattle and oil
Are the products of Abilene soil:
Creaky derricks a sight,
Pumping all through the night
To keep west Texas commerce aboil.

When Alison had an allision
She claimed that Vic blocked out her vision.
The theory I'd float
Why she hit the moored boat
Is quite simple: no steering precision.

I hope wifey won't mind if I mention
How she deals with my  sexual tension.
She rolls out her old trick
Of pretending she's sick:
A device to distract my attention.

Find these ferns in a tropical area.
They were once used for treating malaria.
When a patient bemoans
His non-healing sick bones,
Chinese doctors may still give Drynaria.

My interpreter took me aside
With, "Effendi, me Persian, me guide
And me good speaking drogman.
You order big frogman
With scrotum of camel, deep-fried."

Nick was living the high life — such glamour,
All funded by work as a scammer.
He hacked some accounts,
Stealing hefty amounts:
Now the Nicker's banged up in the slammer.

When an argument seems to be stinking,
And you look a bit closer, by linking
Its theories to facts
To deduce what detracts
From its value, that's critical thinking.

My dear brother once gave me a goose.
Did I jump?  No, that goose word's too loose!
Rest, dear reader, at peace:
For its plural is geese!
(Though he did once, when drunk, goose a moose.)

Al swatted a foul to the wall,
And the ball boy recovered the ball.
When he lobbed the ball in,
It struck Al on the shin;
And Al fell, with chagrin, in a sprawl.

I'm about to turn 50.  I dread
Growing old; I'll just stay here in bed.
Still, I have to confess,
Though I feel like a mess,
Having birthdays sure beats being dead.

It's true that these Prague streets are wrecked,
But they're far from the worst roads we've Czeched.
If we repave the streets,
Our quick action defeats
Other avenue avenues spec'd.

"Bring me gin!" he exclaimed with ferocity,
Then drank with prodigious velocity.
He began with a snort
And consumed the whole quart;
I've no doubt of the man's ebriosity.

Dude! You should do it! You should!
It's amazingly, awesomely good!
First you jump from the plane,
Then the rush melts your brain!
I would do it myself, if I could.

In a traffic jam cars came to rest,
And their bridling drivers, depressed,
As their car engines idled,
Saw, handsomely bridled,
A horse overtake. Legs are best!

If you run a big firm, you're the skipper,
And one day, while you're feeling quite chipper,
You go buy a new biz,
Sell its parts in a whiz;
Even clothed, you're a fine asset stripper.

Extreme sports aren't for me, I confess.
Give me fun where the death rates are less.
Some embrace bunjee jumping
To get their hearts pumping,
But me? I'll take checkers or chess.

He's a calamist: one of the breed
That plays on a pipe with a reed,
Not a columnist whose
Calamitous views
Include calumnies meant to mislead.

At his bedside we struggled to hear,
Then he coughed, and he whispered, "Draw near."
So we all gathered round.
Father's terminal sound
Was: "Could one of you fetch me a beer?"

It's an orangey yellow, or might
Be a yellowish brown, rather light;
And though cotrine's more red
Than spruce yellow, it's said
That the difference between them is slight.

Father John is a cleric and bearer
Of news that, by rites, should be rarer.
Seems a test will reveal
He's a father for real,
The result of a clerical error.

His good looks and fine manners? Appealing.
I would never have guessed he was stealing,
But our audit, revealing
The facts, set me reeling.
Now I'm feeling the need for Darjeeling.

Though all day we've been crouching in ditches,
With dogtags and ammo and itches,
We cannot afford
To get careless or bored,
Or our aidman will have us in stitches.

This old musket of mine is front loading;
Down the muzzle I load, with foreboding.
Yes, the gun is a fusil,
And any misuse'll,
I fear, have the damn thing exploding.

I've a grudge, so I'll now discommode you.
I'll search for new prickles to goad you:
I'll play snare drums each night,
Write long screeds full of spite,
And my booby-trapped loo will explode you.

How are parts of an object related?
An exploded view drawing's created
That intends, as its goal,
To depict how the whole
Is achieved—how assembled / collated.

In the nursing home, stories were told
Of an octogenarian bold.
He dared pick several locks,
Just to enter Fort Knox,
Where he put silver threads 'mongst the gold.

"I request to be castrated, Doc."
"Eighty bucks. Be right here, four o'clock."
Said a roommate, when through,
"You were circumcised too?"
"That's the word!!!" (as he went into shock).

A philanthropist, Francis X. Smith,
Made a sizeable gift to B'nai B'rith.
His foundation was newish,
And Frank wasn't Jewish;
A thank you note followed forthwith.

"I would bet my best horse and gold ring
That soon we will follow our king
Into France," said Prince John.
"It is nearly foregone.
How'd I learn that? I heard a bird sing."

"Our lives become blah-er each year
With a dulness that drains out the cheer.
Every day without fail
Is predictable, stale."
"Oh, I knew you would say that, my dear."

A Manchurian Candidate, Jack,
Had no manicures once he came back.
For if anyone lingers
At ends of his fingers,
He screams: "It's no nail, it's attack!!"

"My plane is airworthy!" he said,
As I laughed at the craft in his shed.
Its wings were askew
And its canvas torn through;
If he took this plane up he'd be dead!

Dear, that scheme is distinctly depressing.
The rate's astronomic, I'm guessing.
Renting land on Uranus
Is likely to drain us —
No, I don't think I'll give it my blessing.

The number to phone in a fix?
999, here in Britain. Don't mix
Up your up and your down,
Or the upright will frown:
You'll be calling the Beast, 666.

At the zoo, as the keepers resume
Their talk of the best way to groom
Mice and squirrels, and more
Little beasts, they ignore
The elephant there in the room!

It went up with a writhe and a hiss,
Being snatched from its grasses of bliss.
I'm not fooled by a swerve
When there's dinner to serve;
Chicks give thanks that this eagle don't miss.

If you're sitting there wondering why
Old bowlers, it's said, never die,
It is clear, beyond doubt,
They have just skittled out
To that great bowling lane in the sky.

It's not easy to be sympathetic
When a roommate becomes enuretic
(Starts wetting the bed)
In the bunk overhead.
It's no wonder you're getting frenetic.

Exasperation! That's just what I feel
Stuck in traffic. I fume at the wheel.
Like this moron ahead—
Is he drunk? Is he dead?
Hit the gas, you old fart! What's the deal?

The doctors in ACOG are givers
Of care that would give me the shivers.
When you're pregnant, in labor,
Don't call for your neighbor;
Remember that ACOG delivers!

It's on us; feel the stifling onus
Of fixing the shipping room's slowness.
If we don't push some more
To get stuff out the door,
We'll get zilch for an end-of-year bonus.

What is good? Only virtue, and so,
All life's comforts the Cynics forgo.
Self-control is the key
When one chooses to be,
From conventional practices, free.

So, this character; where is he from?
Was his father a prince, or a bum?
What's he hate or enjoy?
What's his backstory, boy?
How'd he get to be who he's become?

With his affably cheery 'hello!'
He's acquaintable — easy to know.
Heart and soul of the party,
He's likeably hearty,
But the strain is beginning to show.

The arrogant elephant tends
To avoid ever making amends,
Which can risk disaffection
And outright rejection
By all of his elephant friends.

As history's leaving its mark,
There's some outrage it's likely to spark.
Rolling on midst the fuss
Is the caravan; thus,
It's no matter how much the dogs bark.

As a bit of a lexical buff,
I adore, on TV, Call My Bluff.
With one word to define,
Guests tell tales. Task: divine
What's the deft def and which defs are duff.

A bird in the hand, it is said,
Is worth two in the bush. If, instead,
The retained bird is freed
To grab two (foolish greed),
You may well find that all then have fled.

Though our intake of liquor is rationed,
There's a use upon which I'm impassioned.
To acquiet, I say,
Babes the old-fashioned way:
When they cry, mix the brats an old fashioned.

"Though you're locked," said the doc, "in a squat,
It's not arthrogryposis you've got."
"But Doc," I reacted,
"My joints were contracted
At birth, so please cease talking rot."

When you're dressed to the nines, you appear
In the fanciest outfits.  It's clear
You're a hip fashion plate.
I must say you look great,
But much greater in nothing, my dear.

Uncle Stan's not my favorite man.
I avoid him whenever I can.
He's a doubter, a skeptic;
He's dour, dyspeptic.
I'm glad that he's moved to Japan.

The view through a liberal's prism
Gives cause for a national schism.
By his run-away spending
And taxes non-ending,
He advocates pure socialism.

"Your first line in this lim is no thriller,
'Cause your pillar is only a filler.
Words that just take up space
Are a total disgrace!"
Man, this WE is a killer!

The professor began his polemic.
"This problem," he said, "is systemic.
All our money, it seems,
Goes to basketball teams,
As our college is antiacademic!"

'Twas a curious form of hypocrisy
To pretend that we practiced democracy.
At congressional heights,
One would find only whites—
In the pale (mostly male) chromatocracy.

You've been burnin', but Jack, you ain't done
Till you give 'em your ceiling note, son.
Point your ax at the sky;
Blow it higher than high.
On the trumpet, you're second to none.

I went out for a walk.  On returning,
My wife said I have to start learning —
I'd stoked up the fire
Which had made her perspire.
(This occurs when the woodstove is burning.)

Warned of threats, all the ducklings will drop
Quickly under the water: they dop,
While the dopping of shelducks
Flies off. Go-to-hell-ducks?
No, a sheldrake distractional op.

The horseracing gates are not set,
But as always, I'm placing my bet.
I don't care where they start;
It's an ante-post art
(Never mind that I haven't won yet).

There are bronchial vessels—the veins,
Also arteries—nature maintains
In the lobes of each lung.
You will find them among
Sacs of air in histology stains.

Mimi hatched a nefarious scheme
That made all of her French teachers scream.
She sold shares in a store
That's not there anymore;
And she took them for every decime.

In acoustic aphasia, a word
(Well, its sound) can be perfectly heard,
But to understand speech
Is a task out of reach—
It sounds garbled or scrambled or blurred.

This evil alliance began
With Germany's Aryan plan.
Fascist Italy joined
And "the Axis" was coined.
Added last? Hirohito's Japan.

Croatia's a place you might go
To enjoy Balkan culture and flow.
Dubrovnik and Split
Are each always a hit
With the tourists who travel to CRO.

Malignant old Mortimer Morehead
Has distinguished himself as a sorehead
With a singular new
Middle-finger tattoo
Ostentatiously placed on his forehead.

David Beckham has earned lots of fame
Since he first started playing his game,
And great bundles of cash
That he keeps in a stash
To support his four kids and posh dame.

When hyperinflation holds sway,
He will sprint to the bank with his pay
And convert it to dollars.
In panic, he hollers,
"My cruzeiros are draining away!"

Like dough over-risen, my face
Hangs in folds. It's cosmetic, this case.
Send for surgeons. Make speed.
It's a scalpel I need,
As a face-lift puts all back in place.

It's Thanksgiving, so cut out your stressing,
And quit all that roasting and messing!
Please take back your turkey
And ditch the tofurkey.
Let's face it, my weakness is dressing.

A cytotechnologist can,
With the aid of a sample and scan,
Detect cancer in cells,
And a doctor then tells
The ill patient the news man to man.

If your favourite maiden is dusky,
And tends to wear perfume that's musky,
One hot night, I suspect
That you two will connect
With words of true love, sweet and husky!

Religious folk make me irate.
How they irritate me when they prate!
They're bothersome bodies
I think of as "Goddies".
And they're right when they say, "Goddies grate!"

John and Cyndy, though often discreet,
Left one heck of a clue on the sheet.
No, it's not what you're fearing—
Cyn lost her pearl earring,
And Ann found the stud—what a cheat!

Our pastor exclaimed with dismay:
"We are here not to play, but to pray!"
But a mischievous elf
Then asserted itself,
And a bingo game started that day.

My caloric consumption is strange,
And my diet I must rearrange.
My weight is so high,
Doctor says I could die—
I want ice cream first! Find me some change!

What we're doing in bed isn't right —
Off to church now to get the green light!
Be my new blushing bride;
Let's go cast sin aside
And get back in the sack before night.

The counterintelligence head
Asked that disinformation be spread
To befuddle our foes.
I obliged, bringing woes
To the organizations I fed.

In an effort to stop being bored,
Since the firing fiasco with Ford,
Susan's learned how to code
And her programming's flowed
To create an A.I. code-named "Sword".

The boules that they use in pétanque
Are metallic, and land with a clonk
When they're tossed at the jack
Made of wood, which goes crack—
C'est le clonk et petonk et bedonk.

Some animals walk on their toes,
Like coyotes and lions and crows.
A toe-tappin' brigade;
They're called digitigrade.
Ballerinas are not (just in shows).

There was a musician named Amber
Who played the viola da gamba
In such a bad way
That she heard people say,
"Her fingers—they just seem to clamber."

Adolescents go crazy and squeal;
You expect me to grovel and kneel?
He's a no-talent pest
And I'm flat unimpressed.
So he gyrates to music—big deal!

Every beat of my heart is for you,
While my pulse (it's dicrotic) has two:
One beat at its peak
And a second that's weak—
This condition's a danger. Who knew?

The wet tea leaves mount up with each strainerful
Until I've achieved a containerful.
But recyclers reject
What I've strained to collect:
"It's non-compost." What's meant is: no-brainerful.

When she cares for her delicates, Heather
Will hand-wash these items together:
Garments soft to the touch,
Bras and panties and such
(Not including those made out of leather).

A clan of hyenas will tackle
Any kill left by lions. Their snack'll
Be meat that's still fresh
Or repugnant, rank flesh,
And their laugh marks this group as a cackle.

There was a young lady named Flo
Whose blood count and weight were too low.
Her prescribed builder-upper
(Used right after supper)
Restored all her get-up-and-go.

Purchase Greenland right now? What's the fuss?
It'll cost us a bundle, and plus,
Given climate change fears,
If we wait a few years,
That big island will float down to us.

When it comes to its value, our house
Is depreciative, leading my spouse
To bemoan, "It's so low,
It's now less than we owe!"
Like she needed a reason to grouse!

In her "temple", she'd pamper and feast us.
She buttered us up and she greased us,
But our self-styled "High Priestess"
In truth's just a beastess:
This she-creature's duped, fooled and fleeced us.

Through my thought process, I'll try to guide you;
Explanations I'll gladly provide you.
When the word chip I see,
I think "monk", and then "key".
(And if you think like me, woe betide you.)

"I was watching.  I must've just missed her!
She pilfered my robot's transistor!
I hereby aver
That the guilt lies with her!"
And he glared at his little kid sister.

There's a fact, when I lecture my class on
Arms and armour, I take care to pass on:
This word means the bow
Of the saddle, and so
Not the part that you settle your arçon.

Where are country and western and dancin'
And music from Broadway entrancin'?
Where do fans whoop and holler
To pay bottom dollar?
In America's touristy Branson.

Cook with leaves from a dill plant today.
Use them fresh, use them dried, either way.
As an herb it's called dill weed,
So season at will.  Feed
On foods that fulfill.  Don't delay!

What's this thing that they call dirty float?
Grungy Mardi Gras truck? Filthy boat?
A soda jerk's frappe
That's loaded with crap?
It's a government rate change (take note).

It's an obvious, simple banality
That atoms may form a totality.
Many elements go
To make aggregates, so
We say compounds have elementality.

The next time you say, "She's a cutie,"
Consider it also your duty
To examine what backs this:
A well-centered axis,
Begetting, through symmetry, beauty.

Got a grudge. That my foe wouldn't budge meant
I sued. That the judge likes to bludge meant
"Decision reserved".
There's no justice been served—
Twelve months gone, still no entry of judgment.

"To be modest, one always wears trunks
When, in wading through marshes, one dunks,
Catching creatures paludinal,"
Says the old consuetudinal—
A book on the customs of monks.

Work assiduously. That is the best
Way to study, prepare for a test.
Though your brain may succumb
And your body go numb,
You will come out ahead of the rest.

Think of Wolfie and Felix and Shirley:
Child prodigies all, who quite early
With music and acting
Great fame were attracting—
Their hair? Only Shirley's was curly.

Auntie Bea's yellow teeth were a sight
Till the dentist set everything right.
Now when Bea grins at me
I can no longer see,
For her teeth became blindingly white.

The tough john was demanding his dough back;
The rough pimp was demanding his ho back.
While they were discussing,
The dealer was fussing —
Demanding his coke (that's his blow) back.

It's so sad, being sick, but what's sadder—
My nurse makes me madder and madder.
That dame with ten thumbs
With a catheter comes
And tries ramming it into my bladder.

If at pinball you cheat, you're a tilter.
If your girl's heart you break, you're a jilter.
If your car's running rough
With a huff and a puff,
Then it may be you need an air filter.

He was last to face Ruth in a game.
He was first to face Jackie of fame.
Who's this John on the mound
Who would rarely give ground?
Does anyone know his last name?

You're amoral? You don't have a code
That will guide you down life's bumpy road.
But immoral? It's clear
That you do have one, dear,
But despite it, your sins haven't slowed.

Ectoparasitically feeding,
The grub chews away while I'm weeding.
As it nibbles a leaf,
I say, "Limit my grief:
Try to work on the plants I'm not needing."

If your oxygen usage is whacked,
Sampling gas from your blood can, in fact,
Help the specialists see
(From results ABG)
The cause of your problem, exact.

A comedian's music hall ditty,
Seen as racy by toffs in the city,
Was a song, sung at speed,
From an orchestra lead,
And was thought jolly fun, and quite witty.

There's a new kid in town, named CAT6;
Data cabling now comes with new tricks.
Ten times faster, it's true,
It can route your power too.
Old CAT5? Why, that's just for the hicks!

Evenhanded, am I, to a T.
My rulings have never, you see,
Been anything but
Equipondious; what
Partiality is, isn't me.

Abyssinians lived on the Nile,
A people of substance and style.
Where their kingdom was grand
Ethiopians stand—
In a land where survival takes guile.

Doctor Rose? Her response was moronic—
Instead of prescribing a tonic
For the cold in Joe's nose,
Chose a hose, I suppose—
She decreed that he'd need a colonic.

On a date, when I feel an attraction,
My body is called into action.
My head feels a rush,
My cheeks flush as I blush;
I react with extreme calefaction.

I have a small chance now to gloat.
No barnacles cling to my boat.
A big secret it ain't:
Antifouling in paint
Keeps those suckers off, coat after coat.

See the wheat spike, the anthers protrude;
From the mid-spikelets first, they are viewed.
At this flowering stage
The proud farmer may gauge
What could soon turn to oodles of food.

Those barbershop songs are great things:
A quartet or a chorus that sings—
Tenor, lead, bass, and bari's
Close harmony marries
Four notes, and the chord locks and rings.

Old McDonald's a guy with a farm
Who thinks consonants cause only harm.
He is safe, he supposes,
With E's, I's, and O'ses —
Vowel movements will cause no alarm.

To prove he's a geek, not a goof,
Said the teacher, "Just look at the roof
Of this mighty cathedral;
Its shape is dihedral.
Come in, now, don't stand there aloof!"

We use centi- for point-oh-one meters;
On occasion, it's point-oh-one liters.
But the bug that you meet
Having point-oh-one feet
Has encountered some centipede eaters.

There's an odd, indefinable charm
To my boom truck's extendable arm.
Heavy goods still need crating?
She's my lady in weighting.
Then she'll hoist any burden—no harm.

"Calee-fawn-ee-uh's" governor, Arnie,
Sees his law-making bunch as a carnie.
They're "girly men"—wimps,
He declares, but this simp's
Just a RINO and chock-full of blarney.

What's a battlement? It is a sort
Of a parapet, built on a fort.
A battement, by the way,
Is a move in ballet:
Foot kicks out, foot comes back.  End report.

In college, when nature would storm,
Kate watched thunderbolts, studied their form.
She'd predict, from the lightning,
Dire prophesies frightening—
The demise of each girl in the dorm.

The dragon, though tiny, was spinulated.
His spine, for defense, was echinulated.
Each prickle that rose
Could bring death, Heaven knows,
Since each barb was, in fact, acuminulated.

I haven't yet gained the aroma
Of competence, nor my diploma,
But this bottle of drops—
I am certain it stops
All the symptoms I have of glaucoma.

Just confused? As they zig and they zag
Through the flour that escapes from the bag,
These small beetles proceed
To meander and feed—
Leaving frass in my food. What a drag!

In the days before Daphne was dead,
A deathwatch was held near her bed,
And as part of the vigil
An astrologer's sigil
Was painted in red on her spread.

With stems that have many a node—
Damp heathland their common abode—
Like a necklace that's strung
From white coral among
Simple leaves, this small beauty's bestowed.

A cobbler decided to stay
In Achille, a town in OK.
As he opened a store,
He sent adverts galore
For "Achille's Heels — Opening Day."

When some folks, with one purpose, feel free
To diverge from the group view, we'll see
Them pursue different aims
Or political claims.
Thus a faction has formed. Q.E.D.

Stick before it an ef or a re,
Or just leave it without any pre-
fix: the word doesn't change
What it means. Is that strange?
Fulgent dazzles and shines in all three.

The people in admin are great!
My requests to their desk never wait.
They're as fast as can be—
My name's Colin, you see,
And I run the Department of State.

When constructionists call themselves strict,
Their votes are a cinch to predict.
Though the Founders were mute
Re: a software dispute,
Corporate interests are sure to be picked.

"We should conversate more," Julie purred.
I purred back, "To converse is preferred."
She's a fox? I don't care.
I will end our affair.
Sorry, conversate isn't a word!

What's a sapling? A young beech or birch.
Right. Now, fledgling? I know, needn't search —
It's a chick. I can't miss.
That's correct. Now try this.
What's an egling? Um, I'm in the lurch...

Late at night by the light of a candle,
Taking shafts from my shed steals a vandal.
I do not know his name.
And my tools? Just the same,
They're not ansate: all lacking a handle.

An oafish and arrogant fellow
Unsheathed in my favourite bordello.
I said to him, "Sir,
You're an ignorant cur!"
And, unbuttoned, I won that duelo.

To fend (ward) off boredom, he said,
"I'll write x lims while naked in bed."
Though he earnestly strived,
His strange vow was short-lived;
Seems his x-drive surrendered and fled.

Other lawyers would say with disdain
That Jane's kindliness made her a drain
On the legal profession;
They coined an expression:
Want friendship? Call Amity Jane!

Life's too brief to be dull and uptight.
Sweet diversions deliver delight:
Entertainment's a treat
That makes life more complete,
So let me entertain you… tonight.

A vessel, a queen (not quite new):
Both are known as Elizabeth II.
Though the reigning queen's heir
May be losing his hair,
She still sticks to the throne. (Who said "glue"?)

The thread of my dream is oblique:
A pudding-laced caper antique,
Not of Swiss Miss or Jell-Os
Or Weird Harold fellows.
It's allemain acrobats seek.

Every second, a female gives birth,
Dropping babies for all that she's worth.
Though her birthrate's impressive,
It's hardly excessive:
Those insects lay claim to the Earth.

By dissecting the date when you hatch,
Genethliac gurus can match
The stars to your traits.
They foretell future fates,
Like the way you'll most likely dispatch.

Wayne complains I can't make coffee right;
Give him black and he wants coffee light,
So I hope some day we
Are all forced to drink tea—
When the world has a great coffee blight.

Guys are oafs, since the species began,
And a woman, pursued with a plan,
Who's been asked to undress
Without tact or finesse,
Has been clumsily handled by man.

When in Paris, class tickets were nixed
For the Metro, all passengers mixed,
And today it's a fixture:
This awkward commixture
Of the poor and the comfortably fixed.

This botanical class is for laymen.
Part one: it's the male part we're namin'.
It's protruding — exserted —
Now don't be perverted!
Let's say it together: "the stamen."

Claims adjusters, insurance-type guys,
Are so easy to hate and despise.
It seems like they aim
To deny every claim.
Do those "good hands" hold nothing but lies?

Hey Midas, want gold? Well, you hinted
You did; all you touched became tinted.
Advanced auriphrygia—
You hated it, didja?
I would, if my golden girl glinted.

Carrot Rebel: a cheese that is orange.
(And right there's where this verse falls apart.
Sure, the meter's OK,
But the A-rhymes? No way!
Well, at least I can give it five lines.)

The bright and the beautiful, all
The beings of earth, great and small,
Are creatures (creations)—
Two more,  innovations:
R2-D2 and Threepio the tall.

There once was a saucy young wench,
Who spoke in Canadian French.
From Moncton to Québec,
She left men in a wreck,
Giving hearts (and more parts) quite a wrench.

The blue heron, with long legs and beak,
Hunts for frogs in the depths of the creek.
As it soars to the fog
Of its home near the bog,
It exhibits a noble physique.

Creativity always excites,
And Chef's dishes are full of delights:
Local esculent greens
Which he seeks, plucks and cleans.
So our nights reach spectacular heights.

A bull fly observed with a sigh,
"No matter how often I try,
I'll bite through the hide
Of some bovine backside,
But I can't ever suck them bone dry."

So what's the big deal? I'm a cad.
Sure, I lie and seduce them. Too bad.
We all have a good time
While it lasts and then I'm
On to others—who cares if they're mad?

From their diploid cells, some clever greens
Make gametophytes (spreaders of genes).
Think it sounds too preposterous?
No, just aposporous.
(Wish I knew what all that means!)

The ciliary arteries supply
Blood to various parts of the eye.
From there the blood drains
Through the ciliary veins,
And flows back to the heart, by and by.

It was clear that our marriage was toast.
To a dalliance or two I'd been host.
Maybe three.  Perhaps four.
Maybe seven or more.
OK, fifteen or twenty, at most!

I leave work at a quarter-past five,
Headed home. But this route that I drive
Is bumper-to-bumper
To bumper-to-bumper;
It's ten by the time I arrive.

I'm supposed to be feeling some guilt
'Cause I stepped on the castle you built?
Don't go bawling to Dad;
He'll just tell you, "Too bad.
We don't cry over milk that is spilt."

In the Bronx, ambisexual means,
Like, your "heteroflexible" scenes
And becoming "bi-queer"
For a week or a year.
(Those are terms used by Stuyvesant teens.)

Put up or shut up, says you.
Must I choose one from out of the two?
The exclusive OR, brother,
Means one or the other,
Not neither or both, makes it true.

Our family's cook is called Dinah.
She was taught down in South Carolina,
Where she learned from her poppa,
Who liked to use napa
(That celery cabbage from China).

Submerged in hot fat, or deep-fried,
Is the way to cook doughnuts; I've tried.
Make just one, two or three,
Then a few more for me.
Is it bad for your health? You decide.

Though I seem to be laid back and chilled,
When I look at the poster I'm thrilled.
There's my name in the cast;
I've achieved fame at last —
It's as "Cow (the back end)" I am billed.

Now silent, she once was verbose.
She is dumpish; she's sad and morose.
Here's her doc's diagnosis:
"A depressive neurosis
Any fool could, with ease, diagnose!"

First a habit, now shawls that are woven;
First God, now a god with feet cloven.
She's finished and done
With her years as a nun;
From the convent, she's gone to a coven.

Take a grapefruit, a pungent selection.
Between "poles", cut a simple cross-section.
You've a radiant spot
For a cherry, and not
Many calories . . .  diet perfection!

Took my girl on a boat, a chalupa.
Our ride was (romantically) supa
Till I happened to trip.
As we started to flip,
She said, "Time for a dip!" What a troupa!

Use some eyeliner, lipstick, and base
To improve your appearance in case
You've the hots for that guy.
You will best catch his eye
With cosmetics.  Go fix up your face.

There's a problem that has me obsessed.
It keeps me awake; I can't rest.
Though I think day and night,
I just can't get it right:
Before barns, where did barn swallows nest?

To some Mormons resistant to change,
Arranged marriages, sadly, aren't strange.
Even children are pressed
Into wedlock out West
In polygamous homes on the range.

Seeking smoky-sweet meat and a brew,
Tasty pork chops and short ribs to chew?
Take this road for a spell,
And prepare to eat well
At an ALL U CAN EAT BBQ.

NASA's flipped over Boeing's new rover:
This new model will put them in clover.
They are wildly impressed,
Since in every last test
It stayed upright: it never flipped over.

The place is in trouble, no wonder.
It seems like a terrible blunder.
Since dancing's a no-no,
"St. Mary's a-Go-Go"
Is a convent that'll prob'ly go under.

A crop tree can play a big role,
Like becoming a telephone pole,
Or in some other clever
Commercial endeavor,
Like cork, used to stop up a hole.

At the still it was just me and Clem.
He said, "Call this good hooch? I condemn
This here batch, it's too weak.
Needs a tweak up to peak —
Put it through once again. Let's dephlegm."

A manager dictates a lot
For a steno to scribble and jot.
The requirement thence is
A good amanuensis
To write what the others have not.

Heart racing, you wisely suspect
There's a chemical cause. You connect
The inhaled marijuana
And gulped belladonna
To strong chronotropic effect.

I'm a feminine kind of a fem.
If you'd like one, well, I'm one of them:
I'm girlish, petite,
Kinda dainty and sweet,
A true lady-like treat — I'm your gem.

To hollow a hole in a hill
For a burrow, a burro named Bill
Has to borrow a barrow
That's horribly narrow:
He's afeared of a hell of a spill!

Devolution's about distribution
Of power. With fair execution,
A state that accedes
To its regional needs
Achieves peace and avoids revolution.

Though his grades back in high school earned praise,
His first essay from Cambridge displays
A distinct lack of smarts,
And so now he departs,
Going down after thirty-two days.

I don't know about Him. There's no pull
That I feel to a church, mosque or shul,
So the pious are caustic,
And they ask me, "Agnostic,
Don't you see that our faith makes life full?"

The mountains are sheer here, but dear—
There's no way we can pay our stay here,
Though the Dolomites' ice
And snow seem so nice:
Cortina? Not this year, I fear.

Sally's temperature's soaring, and how!
Beads of sweat lie like pearls on her brow.
She's so feverish, I
Am afraid she might die.
She thinks I'm Florence Nightingale now!

I have on my heel a monstrosity
That I think is an awful atrocity.
This tough hardened skin
Causes constant chagrin.
It's what doctors have dubbed a callosity.

Your complaint will induce my abuse,
As my fight will not end in a deuce.
While your tiniest grumble
May seem like a mumble,
I'll yell till I'm purple and puce.

The snow had charged in like a beast
(It had blown for a week from the east).
I was housebound, I found,
Drifted in all around.
Then came stillness—the wild winds had ceased.

When huge airliners nose-dive to doom,
Large debris fields can add to the gloom.
Over broad swaths of ground
Mass destruction is found,
Like our dear daughter Marylou's room.

Commodiousness is like sun
If you're camping, and rain has begun.
When you're buying a tent
And don't want to repent,
Take the number you meant, and add one.

D. Bernoulli was early and great:
When he published a book on the state
Of his knowledge on flow—
Which was not at all low—
It was seventeen-thirty-and-eight.

The eponymous Ford Model T—
Its mode of construction would be
Something very home grown
That would later be known
As Fordism, writers agree.

That live wire—downed and sparking—can burn you,
But of course, that won't really concern you,
Nor high voltage's clout
Rouse your fears. I've no doubt
When it floors you, you'll laugh and cry, "Durn you!"

Aposematism: color me bright —
Often yellow, red, black and/or white —
Like a traffic sign. "Whoa!
Take my warning, and know
That I'm toxic or yukky. Don't bite!"

We're besieging the king, that old goat,
With our catapults right at his throat.
  And I'm sure we'll engender
  A speedy surrender
If we can get over that moat.

An old dachshund was pissed, through and through.
"When it comes to my breed, let's review:
I'm a 'DOX-hoond,' he'd wheeze,
Not a 'DASH-hound.' Puh-leeze,
Do I look like a sprinter to you?"

The inmate was bad to the bone.
He was evil and cold as a stone.
So when up for parole,
And with freedom his goal,
He still struck quite a truculent tone.

To be able just means you can do it.
Have faith in your strength — just go to it!
If you think that you can,
You can beat any man.
(It's surprising how few will see through it!)

One day orders came down: Phnom Penh—
"Hit their airfields again and again."
With the planes thick as flies
In Cambodian skies,
Patty registered kills three through ten.

There's an acne-faced bald guy named Dudley
Whose potato physique is quite spudly.
He's got arms that are thin,
And a long pointy chin,
And yet doubtless believes himself studly.

When a theatre puts on a revue,
Without doubt it's a fun thing to do.
Known as follies, one kind
Is the best you can find—
Singing, dancing, and glam females too!

Sid likes cornflakes for breakfast each morn.
His wife Sadie's reaction is scorn.
"You reread the same box
Every morning," she mocks,
"With such passion, you'd think it was porn!"

Assamese is an Indian tongue
Unrelated to Mon-Khmer or Hmong.
To Bengali, one letter
Is added to better
Write double-U sounds for the young.

The asthenosphere really is not
An inviting or welcoming spot,
For it's frightfully deep
('Nuff to make the skin creep)
And the climate's oppressively hot.

He assured them he'd guarantee growth
Or make good any loss to them both,
But the stock market crashed
After which, unabashed,
He reneged and went back on his oath.

The current production rate's less
Than a Ginnie Mae mortgage. Excess
For commission we earn
From the half-a-point turn,
And the holders of bonds acquiesce.

My robot's A.I. blows away
Any battlebot running today.
I'm a techie whose life's
So absorbed that my wife's
Got an itch only droids can allay.

Just seeing her gives me a thrill:
At each meeting, she's bonnier still.
She is someone so comely,
I stare at her dumbly,
Besotted, bereft of free will.

From Saskatchewan, fed by the snows,
The Assiniboine River now flows
To the east—to the Red,
Which runs northward instead
To Lake Winnipeg. That's how it goes.

Some Beefeaters, guards at the Tower
Of London,  are feeling quite sour:
A bird in their ranks?
Her appointment there's  thanks
To her years in the army. Girl power!

"If your plant's using plants to supplant
A synthetic reagent, I'll grant
That it's chemurgy, man,
Like that corn-to-fuel plan…"
[We've omitted his two-hour rant.]

You're adherently sticking like glue.
You remind me of cling wrap, you do.
You're attached at my hip.
Baby, loosen your grip.
Give me space or, my darling, we're through.

Telemarketers boldly accost
Us at dinner, the salad just tossed.
They don't know us at all
When they make a cold call.
Any wonder they're greeted with frost?

A backscratcher helps quite a lot
When you itch in a difficult spot.
I could do with one now
But the problem, somehow,
Is her birthday's the one I forgot.

It's an act, and a good one, no doubt,
All those frogskins the fraud's doling out.
But the sight folks recall
Was mere singles for all.
He's a fake and a cheapskate — devout.

The horse tugged, but the cart would not start.
To the driver I yelled, "Have a heart!"
To direct folk's attention,
I yelled my dissension:
"Get a load of the load on that cart!"

It's carefulness, mindfulness, heed,
And discretion this gambler will need
To exhibit to get
Himself clear of his debt,
But, alas, he's bedeviled by greed.

While playing a game of canasta,
I noticed a worm in my pasta:
Some moth larvae squirming
Went far toward confirming
My dinner contained Anagasta.

Victor Borge was clearly distraught
At the cost of whatever he bought.
He explored its relation
To language inflation—
A thoroughly asi-ten thought.

Some people are accident prone.
They shouldn't go out on their own.
They walk into doors,
End up on all fours,
Fall down manholes and break every bone.

At first meeting, she'll often put on
A façade, her warm nature withdrawn.
She seems brittle and cool—
But have patience, and you'll
See she's sweet as a sparrow at dawn.

Caesar Adrian, Roman of sense,
Built a wall that was thick and immense.
	Kept barbarians out,
	But the neighbours did shout
At the bill for their half of that fence!

A woman named Abigail Park,
Whose knowledge tree's missing some bark,
Thinks a flambeau's a mate
Who deceives on a date.
(It's a torch, but she's still in the dark.)

With fuel prices high, I surmise
That our whole cost of living will rise,
For when transport costs more,
So do goods in the store.
And who pays? Every person who buys.

The man who does government work
Enjoys a most valuable perk,
But sometimes he's blamed
And embusqué he's named,
For military roles he can shirk.

You say you're delirious, so
Just keep talking, because I don't know
If you're dizzy with joy
Like a boy with a toy,
Or near dead 'cause your head took a blow.

I took cognizance of my mistake:
Now the buds of my tongue are awake.
No, it's not quite a crime,
But I think that next time
I'll put sugar, not salt, in the cake.

Her mount was a challenging ride,
But she took every fence in her stride,
While displaying a seat
That was comely and neat.
(And some say beauty comes from inside!)

A cardiovascular doc
Makes sure that your ticker can tock.
This surgeon who wrestles
With fast-food-filled vessels
Advises you, "Go for a wok."

Young girls used to walk down the aisle
When wedding while young was the staisle.
Now, to see Mr. Right
Down that aisle of white,
I'll wager you're waiting a whaisle.

Bubba's? Fine for some coffee and cake,
But steer clear of their chicken-fried steak:
The damn batter's rock-hard,
The "house sauce" largely lard
And the "beef"—hell, it's probably snake.

Day faded and on came the night.
The campfire kindling burned bright.
The embers all yellowed
As Tom loudly bellowed,
"I must keep this fire alight!"

"Plans fell through to have dinner at five
Since our guest ran off, smelling of chive.
But we've many a bite
From the skeeters tonight!"
Whined the cannibal, eaten alive.

Alpine touring in Switzerland? Please!
Do you think I've got Superman's knees?
Why'd you think I would like
Such a strenuous hike,
Up a mountain, in snow, and on skis?

Teen shut-in Hermione Morse
Confesses her shyness's source:
"It's really quite simple —
I'm letting a pimple
Run its dermatological course."

Now, what do you call this condition:
In writing this latest submission,
If you just rearrange
Those things you can't change
To savor the sweet apposition?

In flower arranging, a sheer
Spray of cloud grass will often appear
In dried floral bouquets:
And its delicate haze
Will enhance garden ways that are sere.

They divided the fields up among them
And scattered their seeds — well, they slung them.
But their strips, although wide,
Had a baulk at each side,
And so onto the weeds they oft flung them.

A woman I know was defaming
Her husband by loudly exclaiming:
"To clean is a chore
And the damn bathroom floor
Is a mess, Piss for Brains, you're not aiming!"

Take a conjugate acid, e.g.
HCl, and deprotonate: see!
It's turned conjugate base —
Just Cl left in place,
Plus electron — the proton set free.

Where'd you catch that, your last expedition?
Go and seek an emporiatrician.
He's equipped to unravel
Disorders of travel.
Your fierce fungus, for him, is a mission.

Our know-how will market your book:
Inside-peek it—we'll give folks a look.
We'll excerpt the best lewd parts,
Salacious or nude parts,
And use Facebook. Your sales will just cook.

When the hen-courting season is gone,
Bright drakes put drab plumage back on.
With colors less bright,
They'll blend in in day's light,
Eclipsed by the camo they don.

"Your anthroponym, sir," barked the clerk,
As she glared with a mean little smirk.
"Now. I haven't all day."
"Fine; it's Joseph," I say.
"And is yours Mrs. Bitch, or Miss Jerk?"

They're yukky at noon, night or dawn,
And they aren't good decor for a lawn,
Those cowflops. It's time
For a cattle-fold. I'm
Gonna wall an expanse as a bawn.

The third deepest in all the world round
Of all natural harbours is found
In fair Falmouth, a town
Of old Cornish renown:
For both sailing and filming it's sound.

I had danced, every night, the fandango,
Till I slipped on a newly peeled mango.
On my butt I was tossed:
My fast dance skills were lost —
I'm reduced to a slow-moving tango.

Water's freezing both inside and out,
So our pipes are in danger no doubt.
Our power has quit,
A mistake by some twit.
Here the cold packs a powerful clout.

Descriptivism says that my morals
(Value judgements) should never cause quarrels.
My deep motivation
Defies demonstration;
I rest on inscrutable laurels.

Justice Kavanaugh claimed the word boof
Meant "to fart," but he offered no proof.
One would think that no gas
Passed his glorious ass,
Which was flawless, pristine and aloof.

The Blue Riband event can be gruelling
And forbids transatlantic refuelling.
Higher average speed
(Not the time), now agreed,
Is the target of nautical duelling.

My neighbor's just planted a spruce,
With branches wide-spreading, diffuse,
That will damage my fence
And thus cause much expense.
I have pruners; now watch me let loose.

I believe that your facts are mistaken
And a bookish faux pas you are makin'.
He who authored King Lear
And the one I'd revere
Is a guy by the name of Frank Bacon.

The artist Sir Frederyck Phelps
Created a sculpture from skelps.
Says it's better than walls
For airing his smalls.
(You don't have to be mad, but it helps.)

Though he sounds like a drummer, he's not.
He's a beatboxer – hear what he's got.
His astonishing feat
Is in voicing the beat.
His percussion's amazingly hot.

From New York comes the Cortland, a fruit
That's a McIntosh cross, and a beaut.
It's an apple, bright red,
With white flesh that is said
To make pie lovers stand and salute.

"The cook on our ship, to be frank,"
Said the pirate, "was awful.  He drank,
And the food was flawed, faulty:
The soup was so salty!
We made the foul fool walk the plank."

The sages taught Ptolemy's spheres
For a thousand and three hundred years.
Though it lasted for ages,
Arrived at in stages,
To that model now no one adheres.

A cave dweller's living next door
In my skyscraper's 43rd floor.
Since he doesn't come out
Very often, I doubt
That he's noticed it's summer no more.

Achromatic-type vision — that might
Make our colourful world black and white.
If one's eyes use the rods,
But no cones, then the odds
Are the world looks by day as by night.

You have boozed 'til you're thoroughly boozed,
So your order for more was refused.
There is little excuse
For your liquor abuse,
And your friends are no longer amused.

The Communists' creed (or their polity)
Would give people lives of equality,
So they said, but that's not
What most Communists got —
A matter of little frivolity.

To our capital's where you may go
For the best that our nation can show:
From museum displays
To a statue's stone gaze,
And reminders of glory and woe.

It's a rank for a person who's male,
At an abbey where brothers brew ale.
All the monks who have sinned
Are three sheets to the wind,
But this abbotship's not under sail.

To a sightless young lass, Jim opined,
"You would make a great date — would you mind?"
Jim got pickled one night,
So she dared, in his plight,
Walk him home, the blind leading the brined.

His desire was growing: "I ache
For a taste of your sweet honey cake."
She said, "Step off the gas
For I shan't be a lass
With a bun in the oven to bake."

Though assassinate simply means "slay,"
It's not used for just any old prey,
Only big VIPs,
So don't murder me, please;
But assassinate? Yeah, well, okay.

Grain and sacrificed animals (male)
Used for offerings, blessings prevail,
And the glory of God
Shone before them abroad:
They fell frontwards, soon prostrate (and pale).

Shop at Bob's. All the experts agree
That his goods are a sure guarantee
Of best values galore
At this great discount store,
Where the cost is at EDLP.

Sir Charles was both learned and suave.  He
Commanded his manservant, Ravi:
"Tell HQ that I've won.
But be brief: use this pun.
Don't say, 'I have Sind.' Say, 'Peccavi'."

Think my brain to be that of a fool?
In D.C. (where the acronyms rule),
"The Decider" should be
CJOTSC,
An erudite man, said my school.

For a nose he'd a bulbous monstrosity —
Such a spherical, pink curiosity
That the doctors were stunned
By this conk so rotund,
With its roundness and swollen bulbosity.

Acid hail is some weather that mars
Metal finishes badly.  It scars
Like its twin, acid rain.
To the crops, it's a bane,
Plus it dimples the hell out of cars.

The sassy Belinda Berlin
Was a brassy identical twin,
And her sister, named Nora,
Was brazen—she wore a
Brassière made of copper and tin.

Must every discussion you enter
Have a pain-in-the-keister dissenter?
That begging-to-differ-
While-boring-you-stiffer
Alternative-viewpoint presenter?

Of some people with dogs I've a craw-full.
They permit defecation unlawful.
"Madame, I'd prefer
That you'd please curb your cur.
The alternative's really quite offal."

The Dutch sailed the southerly seas
On the Lioness, charting with ease.
Other ships with less luck
At Cape Leeuwin struck
Unseen rocks, like the ship Pericles.

That your choice isn't mine there's no doubt,
But it's rude to keep blessing me out.
Such language is brutal.
Opposition is futile:
You know that I've ordered the trout.

The word dropt is just "dropped" with a "t"
In the place of that last p-e-d.
Should "I shopped" be "I shopt"?
Let this madness be stopt!
From now on, all my writing's dropt-free.

Surge protectors I guess I should buy
Since computers are pricey. That's why
If my power's unsteady,
I've got to be ready.
My circuits I don't want to fry.

The law of the jungle's severe.
You must kill to survive, watch your rear.
Gotta eat or be eaten
And fight or get beaten —
You learn a lot, living in fear.

The army will close-clip my head,
And the loss of my dreadlocks I dread.
Once those knots hit the floor
And I'm hairy no more,
I'll have lost not just locks, but my cred.

For Him Magazine (FHM),
UK women know, isn't for them.
The British man's lifestyle
Contrasts with his wife's style:
There's rather more ogling. (Ahem.)

As a rule, I will get up at noon,
Walk my turtle, and feed my baboon.
If it's Friday I'll wash,
Juggle chainsaws and squash,
Then dance naked and howl at the moon.

After dozens of factors were weighed,
A go/no-go decision was made.
On the brink of attack,
There was no turning back.
"Yes, there is!" "No, there's not! We invade!"

A woman (one Candace by name)
By a peppermint stick came to fame.
For on Christmas she took
A straight stick, made a hook.
From her candy cane came her acclaim.

Riders sit and they stare through the glass.
When kids joyfully wave as they pass,
Most will quickly wave back
To the bunch by the shack.
Nearly all bus line clients show class.

Hardened boilerplate's crusting the snow.
Tread with caution wherever you go:
It'll hold then desert you,
And swiftly invert you…
You're sliding? Just go with the flow.

If it's craniosacral, the nerve
Will facilitate functions that serve
To allow us to rest,
Get aroused, and digest—
Several functions I'd like to preserve.

Privileged A-list celebs nod and smile,
Strutting down the red carpet. Meanwhile,
The B-list crowd works
For less swag, fewer perks;
At awards shows they're not on the aisle.

A for effort, in grade school, can mean a
Gold star for Theresa or Tina.
But Bush, on a lark,
Gave Alberto this mark
And gave Brownie points during Katrina.

My deliverness? Gone — no agility!
Nimbleness? Utter futility.
Pretzel-like twisting?
No longer existing!
Return, Time, my lost flexibility!

I'm flat broke and for help I entreat.
In my kitchen there's nothing to eat.
I've no money to feed
My old dad; we're in need,
So I beg and I plead in the street.

A rhino, renowned for its girth,
Draws its breath in for all that it's worth,
Then, with gale-force exhaling,
Sets poachers to sailing
Diffusively over the earth.

Chapters cut? Your decision excisional,
Though you tell me it's only provisional,
Just shows you can't edit
My stuff. Have you read it?
Copy this: now our course is collisional!

I've a lisp and I find ceaselessness is
Not one of my greatest successes.
I make such a mess
Of the sibilant s—
'Coth I'm endlethly thtrething the etheth.

I shot family films, when a lad,
On a great birthday gift from my dad.
Now they sadden him so,
And his spirits are low.
His depressive disorder's real bad.

Don't ignore my impassioned appeal.
I've a problem with which I can't deal.
Call this heartfelt request,
Springing straight from my breast,
Cri de coeur. That's how desperate I feel.

Frank was drunk as a fiddler. They say
This expression comes down from the day
That a fiddler might be
Paid in liquor, you see.
Surely that's why so many would play.

To the Senate comes Brutus one day
In a toga that's yellowish-gray.
It's so out there that Caesar,
A notable teaser,
Can't help but say, "Ecru, Brute?"

Aspirin' to find a good pill,
Doktor Hoffmann, whose father was ill,
Made the aspirin—thank heaven—
In 1897,
Our #1 painkiller still!

Saw a bluebottle fly here and there:
Gimcrack shiny, it danced in the air.
Had 'im cornered for sure
Near a pile of manure.
(Gimcrack cornered? But why would I care?)

My job's card sharping; that's what I do.
I'll gamble at card games with you.
You just wouldn't believe
All the tricks up my sleeve!
My percentage of wins?  Ninety-two.

Cursorius cursor's a bird
Of the deserts, which cover one-third
Of the Earth. But a lover
Of swift, dashing plover-
Like "waders" says Asia's preferred.

At the altar, the bride looked a belle,
But they couldn't afford a hotel
For the bun fight that followed.
Their pride was soon swallowed:
Church halls make good venues, as well.

When the rains came, we sloshed and canoed.
Then our sewers backed up — we were screwed:
Feces flowed in the streets;
Sludge and muck messed our sheets.
Our sweet brook turned from babbling to rude.

Just at moonrise we pause, in suspension,
As the glow on the snow eases tension:
"May I ask your indulgence?
The moon's cool effulgence
Beguiles me; it's worthy of mention."

I've got plenty of passionate fans,
And my talent's as good as a man's,
But I can't get employed —
My morale is destroyed,
So to hell with my life's best-laid plans.

In an airship, way up in the sky,
Was an elegant way, once, to fly.
In the passenger car
You would float near and far;
Have those days of high living gone by?

Was Jesus the same stuff as God?
Fourth century folks found it odd
To think Arian thought.
Athanasians did not.
One substance for both, they'd applaud.

When the test kit was offered, I bit,
And submitted a tube of my spit.
DNA gave a clue:
I've got half-sibs.  Who knew?
I'm just gobsmacked—ne'er soothsayed a hit!

"A hung parliament? Surely you're jokin'!"
Yes, the voters of Britain have spoken,
And they all disagree.
Sounds normal to me—
Who says our democracy's broken?

Dolly Parton was put to the test
When she fell off the boat with no vest.
Her huge boobs were displayed,
And they came to our aid
When  we dragged her ashore, two abreast.

Was Jesus a deity reified?
Or merely a man who was deified?
I care not a jot
For that biblical rot —
I perceive the world totally me-ified!

To this orchestra's fame others yield
In the popular light music field.
Of them all they are tops,
Yes, the great Boston Pops.
For one hundred plus years they've appealed.

When a sailor went out with the fleet,
Long ago, to the tropics, defeat
Dogged the tar with bad luck.
He'd be calenture-struck,
With a fever they blamed on the heat.

There once was a kid from my youth:
Danny Dentoid. (I swear it's the truth!)
So well named was this lad,
On his shoulder he had
A small birthmark the shape of a tooth.

As a woman, I think it is sweet
To be kind to all people I meet.
In the loo, if I know
That a man's next to go,
I considerately lift up the seat.

Pinot grapes should make wine richly red!
These pale things have poor color; instead,
I'll press off the skins
'Ere fermenting begins —
Blanc de noirs ain't a wine we should dread.

In the looking-glass world of young Alice,
Far away from the Queen in her palace,
You'd better not sleep
Where the borogoves creep,
Lest they mimsify you in their malice.

"For Baguette Laonnaise we can thank
Our French friends," says this cheese-loving Yank.
In the fridge, you may find
That you've dried out the rind,
Which will cause this fine cheese to taste rank.

Its leaves, like eight fingers, reach out
Around flowers — white pompoms. No doubt
It is fatsia I've seen —
Whitish blooms, leaves mid-green:
This evergreen shrub's tall and stout.

Crenelated forts were the sites
Of countless historical fights.
The rooftops indented
Quite often fomented
Romance between maids and their knights.

"Computer!" the captain would say,
As he stood on the bridge every day.
"Give me tea.  Make it hot."
And more likely than not,
He would mention his preference, "Earl Grey."

Not too soon to bemoan what's been lost,
After fires we study the cost.
Some species rebound
After years, again found,
While others, less lucky, are tossed.

It's food of the gods, so propitious;
Now we're told that it's  also nutritious.
The darker the better,
Luscious chocolate's a netter
Of raves, food divinely delicious!

An ambitious but fickle Calgarian,
First an oilman and then seminarian,
Also worked as a ploughboy,
A rancher, and cowboy,
Then finished his life a librarian.

If it's feathered, I find it bewitching;
Avicultural facts are enriching.
I dig everything bird,
From the tongue to the turd.
Sure I raise them. They sing when they're bitching.

Brutalization's a useful technique
For getting a pipsqueak to speak.
Or for changing a saint
Into someone who ain't
All that shy about busting your beak.

"Like a fish" is the phrase to describe
How they drink in the Carides tribe.
Shrimp and prawns are enamored
Of drinking 'til hammered—
The decapod way to imbibe.

"What is female-specific? High heels
And long sermons on just how she feels."
So says Jim. "Then, they cry
'Cause — the Devil knows why,
Or a dress that, while hiding, reveals."

"My account of what's female-specific —"
Counters Betty, Jim's wife, "We're prolific:
We're friends, lovers, mothers,
Keep healthy, help others.
Where menfolk might fight, we're pacific."

In computing you can, if you're keen,
Reposition an icon on screen
Making use of your mouse
(It needs minimal nous).
Click and drag, you'll soon get what I mean.

Archaeology: study of old stuff,
Conducted by those who behold stuff
Made by Romans or Greeks.
When the Ancient World speaks,
You should listen, 'cause some of it's gold stuff.

My grandmother's words were prophetic:
"The pace of your life is frenetic;
Soon you'll drink till you puke."
I recall her rebuke;
I take Emetrol (antiemetic).

From Germany's primitive past,
Ambiguous casts were amassed
Of feathery lizards
(For flying through blizzards?).
Archaeopteryx had quite a blast.

The church council gasps as it scans
The new twelve-sided building Stan plans.
"I will build a cathedral
That's dodecahedral,"
He says, "and you'll all become fans!"

You may laugh; I accept your derision,
But I've finally made a decision:
Yes, at long last (I think),
In the end, I'll wear pink.
Or yellow. Last minute revision!

Their activity level? Intense!
They have covered our town with a dense
Grid of trained volunteers
Who would cover our rears
In a crisis—our civil defense.

Not faithworthy, Bess failed the test of her
Loyalty. Todd got the best of her;
I had a cow,
Cause he's kissing her now
And undoubtedly all of the rest of her.

Sabers drawn, flashing steel, row on row,
In the wars not all that long ago:
They'd engage, they'd connect,
With horrendous effect.
Edged weapons would slice through a foe.

With hunting and war (in conjunction)
This antelope's fate's at a junction.
The rare dibatag's life
Is at times full of strife.
It's a case of "erect tail" dysfunction.

A new neighborhood park would be nice.
A discussion group might break the ice.
We could plan, at this start,
On a gym at its heart,
Or might swings and a bike path suffice?

James Bond seemed so manly and bold
That this story has rarely been told.
When a bug laid him low,
He turned gay. Now you know:
He's the spy who came out from the cold.

Disobedience, when it is civil,
Is refusal to kowtow to drivel
The government says
(Like, "We're banning all PEZ").
We'll protest until attitudes swivel.

If you can, line your borders with hedging
(So good for the birds when they're fledging).
But if you've no space,
Keep your soil in its place
By using a strong piece of edging.

To the rye Luke slipped off for some sin —
Later slumbered, stripped down to his skin.
He lay, barely concealed, full
Of ticks and a fieldful
Of mud — and a faceful of grin.

Are there creatures more basic than my toad?
Not a swimmer or diver—a dry toad—
He's content eating flies.
Can you guess my surprise
When I found that the simplest's a cytode?

"Hail Caesar! I have to relate
The barbarian's here, at the gate!
He's dirty, he's savage,
He's ready to ravage."
"I'm bathing. Please ask him to wait."

If you say that it must be admitted
That you tried it for size as you knitted,
That the fit was much better
By shaping the sweater,
Then admittedly it'd be fitted.

I once was elastic and lithe,
And buxom and bonny and blithe,
But age is advancing,
Reducing my dancing—
No bouncing, no prancing: I writhe.

US soldiers, abused without spell,
Very often were killed when they fell.
Japanese were to blame
For this cruel march of shame.
At Bataan war was far worse than hell.

Cursèd gawkiness cuts like a knife —
Extreme awkwardness screws up my life.
Since the day I was wed
I've been bumbling in bed.
At least that's what I'm told.  Ask my wife.

When betting on sports, there's a spread;
Odds are evened that way, I have read.
When the spread hit's exact,
Bettors know for a fact
Clearly all bets are off; the bet's dead.

If I were the one driving here,
There's no one who'd let out a cheer.
When it's right I go left,
And I'm truly bereft
Of a sense of direction, it's clear.

A coxless, competitive four
Must be steered by a rower. What's more,
Poor control of the rudder
(The thought makes me shudder)
Might leave us marooned on the shore.

"The Precambrian age is where I'm
Heading next," Doctor Who said. "This time
I'll do deeds most heroic
In seas eozoic
And create the first lifeforms from slime."

As a female, there isn't a hope
That I'll ever be chosen as pope;
So I'm mad at the church,
As I'm left in the lurch.
Antipapal, I sit here and mope.

Whilst to atheist ears Father-God
May be words that will sound rather odd
(Like The Spirit and Son
With The Father are one),
Many Christians will reverently nod.

I attended a conversazione,
Where the talk was slick, learned — and phony;
When I ventured, "Expect you all
Are, like, intellectual?"
The silence was instant, and stony.

Let's consider the genus Cajanus.
Though line 1 rhymes with penis  and anus,
It is speaking of shrubs
That the average man snubs.
Not alluring like Venus, they've plainness.

What is falsesome? Deceitful, untrue.
Now just five lines remain; what to do?
(The above line's falsidical,
Lying, spurcidical;
It's falsesome, 'cause I'm guileful too.)

The barn owl is thin and prolific.
The sounds he can make are horrific.
He screams and he burbles
And likes to eat gerbils
(Or rodents, to be less specific).

In a typical country-life saga,
As he said (quaffing bitter, not lager),
The posh kitchen, no doubt,
Would be empty without
A big scone-cooking, bum-warming Aga.

A sauce for your salad's a dressing —
Vinaigrette, cooked or creamy — caressing
The greens, veg  or noodles.
It'll often add oodles
Of calories, diet-distressing.

From Disney came gems like Fantasia,
But the crap they make now might amaze ya:
The Travails of Snow White
And Her Fight for the Plight
Of A Septet with Achondroplasia.

Smelt of roses, my gran's chest of drawers.
And when Gran died, my mum said, "It's yours."
Inside, hidden, I found
Scented notes, ribbon-bound —
Billets-doux Gran received in the wars.

"Does she love me or not?"—I was hazy,
Losing track with the petals (a daisy).
Said my buddy nearby,
"You're so goofy, no lie—
You're in love at the level of crazy."

When rain suddenly falls from the sky,
All the groundskeeping staff standing by
Swiftly spring into action
And get under traction
The covers that keep the pitch dry.

Lack of oxygen causes despair
In us humans, but some things don't care.
They suppress this neurosis
Through anaerobiosis
And live in the absence of air.

The director said, "Please dance a two-step."
Paul Udell thought, "That's some sort of new step?"
It was novel, all right:
His attempt was a fright.
Still, they named it for him: "The P-U step."

The hawk gulled the poor blushing crow
Into thinking their love would soon grow.
But that four-flushing craven
Flew off with a raven,
Which dealt her the last, crushing blow.

Destroying a nominee's known
As borking, a practice that's grown.
Opposition attacks
Through political hacks
And the press is how hokum is sown.

My piano, last Thursday, changed hands.
A plush theatre's where it now stands.
But I just didn't know,
When refusing the dough,
My old grand has great value, worth grands.

In a language like English that's not
Phonetically written, you ought
To avoid rhyming love
(Just an eye rhyme) with move:
As a rhyme they'd be not on the dot!

Said a miserly woman named Crandle,
"Wasting money is always a scandal"—
Told her husband, near death,
"When you draw your last breath
Please make sure to extinguish the candle!"

It was breed more than speed that I sought,
So at auction I tried to allot
    Enough for two mares
    And a stallion for heirs,
But a gelding is all that I got.

Your size doubled, but don't be distressed,
'Cuz from my point of view, you're the best.
Your considerableness
Fills a size 40 dress.
You're like two babes in one — I'm twice blessed.

Cryogenic procedures require
Me to don this protective attire,
Since you asked to be frozen
At death, having chosen
To end it in ice and not fire.

High anxiety rules. You can bet
Times are tough as they ever can get.
Nails are bit to the quick;
Rescue comes in the nick.
That was close—Christ, I'm covered with sweat!

When the end of your sock starts to go,
Stick this ovoid device in the toe.
Save your pennies and stitch.
Though it won't make you rich,
Darning eggs help those nest eggs to grow.

Actinolite: rock that is green.
(It's the iron that gives the green sheen.)
Without iron it's white,
Then it's called tremolite.
Its crystals are long, thin, and lean.

Though the clock's loud alarm had long rung,
To the sheets the boy's body still clung.
"Since I know you're awake,
There's no reason to fake,
So get up!" said the mom to her young.

Miss Edna Saint Vincent Millay
Is quoted from Nome to Taipei.
Her candle was splendid:
It burned, double-ended,
And turned one last night into day.

I may have a lopsided grin
In a face that's too fat or too thin
With a nose that's off-square—
But I wear facial hair:
With a beard I design my own chin.

I'm no robot, ma chère—I'm your pa.
Your syndrome? So sad; it's Capgras.
Once we feared you would die;
Now we ask ourselves why
A once-sane girl denies her own ma.

"I've got belonephobia," said Tony,
"And I swear that my fear isn't phony!"
This odd word, it appears,
Means it's needles he fears.
It just looks like he's scared of baloney.

For a paper on subtext I'll read
An old novel that's called Adam Bede.
But sweat beads on my brow
Since this paper's due now,
And ten pages it's got to exceed.

I can bug you and meddle and pry,
Stick my nose in your business and spy.
If you tell me we're through
I'll encroach upon you,
But I'm otherwise not a bad guy.

Acts of state are what governments do;
No one blames them on me or on you.
So we're safe from attack
(For the war in Iraq)
By al-Qaeda and terrorists, too.

Oh boy, am I getting the blues.
Now we're all getting lousy reviews.
When the guy that we nominated
For prez is abominated,
We down-ballot types also lose.

The hours just seem to elapse.
They've slipped by, and I can't fill the gaps.
Time flies, so they say,
But I've lost half my day.
Perhaps it's because of my naps?

For this project we sapped our endowed funding,
And all of our unit's allowed funding.
We're sure to raise dough
(In small chunks) if we go
With an internet show; let's try crowdfunding.

The barmbrack's a soft spicy bread
That's baked up with currants, then spread
With some freshly churned butter.
You'll find it an utter-
ly wonderful meal to be fed.

Cyproheptadine's full appellation
Has a dreadful syllabification.
But try some and see
Just how sweet dreams can be.
Hydrochloride completes the citation.

A dinosaur sick of old tricks
Decided one day to affix
Some feathers and things
To his forelegs (now wings)
To meet archaeopteryx chicks.

Oh, CRAP! — Good, I've got your attention.
Ecphonema's a tactic worth mention.
Cut an air of stagnation
With a sharp exclamation,
And break free of ennui—or ease tension.

They claimed they could fly supersonically,
And their statements were not made ironically.
They arrived from afar
And appeared quite bizarre—
As their skulls and their heads were shaped conically.

It's the time-hardened urine of rats,
Found in caves sometimes lived in by bats.
Called amberat, it's
Used in binding the bits
Of a midden, the home of their brats.

It's a gulch between hills, and is truly
A prairie ravine, a wild coulee.
The land quickly drains
The occasional rains,
Leaving xerophytes rough and unruly.

You thought you could smoke cigarettes.
Call them cancer sticks? Doc's silly threats.
Now you're coughin' too often —
Too soon for a coffin!
Denial can lead to regrets.

Your eye test was not microscopical:
It is clear your complaint's egilopical.
And the way to repulse a
Small eye-corner ulcer?
Read the news! (Yes, the treatment is topical.)

What's a group of vile cockroaches called?
They've invaded my house, I'm appalled!
I'm in total confusion—
They are such an intrusion.
These insects won't leave 'til they're mauled.

The show where her costume gets torn
Leaves poor Janet upset and forlorn.
She reacts to it gloomily,
The butt of contumely—
Contemptuous, arrogant scorn.

My husband, the audiophile,
Is so glued to his stereo dial
That he doesn't yet know
My fidelity's low—
I've been sleeping around all the while.

Politicians are guarded and tight—
While in office—but afterwards might
Work together and chill,
Like George Sr. and Bill.
They're a pair of strange bedfellows, right?

Humpty Dumpty's a lighter and faster piece,
And Paradise Lost a far vaster piece,
But in head-to-head heat
Neither one can compete
With this minor poetical masterpiece.

My ex wears the lovemaking crown.
He's a circus performer in town.
With no suitor out there
Who can even compare,
There's no filling the shoes of that clown.

In your lentiform nucleus sits
Your discrete globus pallidus—it's
Been causing an issue.
These chems will kill tissue:
A chemopallidectomy blitz.

Enliven, it's said, means "make sprightly" —
A smile lights a dull day up brightly.
Think (life of the party,
Her laughter so hearty)
Capote's Miss Holly Golightly.

I'm informed by my high-risk OB,
"There's a blood test that checks AFP.
The results, plus your age,
And the pregnancy's stage,
Show the odds of an ONTD."

I'm an archery-loving inventor.
My device causes arrows to enter
Their targets so no
Imprecision will show:
Every shot hits the mark at dead center.

I like where I live—it's a loft,
But the water is hard and not soft.
Its high mineral load
Means my sink and commode
Need descaling with acid quite oft.

When you enter the U S of A,
They take digital photos today,
And your fingerprints, scanned,
Can be seen through the land,
For your details are bit-mapped. Hooray.

A part of the actor's biography
Was a carefully written filmography
That included each role
He had played, on the whole—
But omitted his stint in pornography.

An(n)ulus: oft we misspell
It before we splice in the -U-L-,
For its root, meaning "ring,"
Had been used for a thing
That bore too unpleasant a smell.

Have you seen an Aquarid today?
After all, it's the fourth day in May.
From Aquarius flocks
Of these meteors — rocks —
Should appear like a heavenly spray.

In front of this vast congregation,
I confess that I practice cenation
Three times daily. It's true,
And I hope you do too!
When we don't, we're inviting starvation.

As a student, I worked as a diener
In the morgue, with a somber demeanor—
Though in medical school
This job was, as a rule,
Little more than a glorified cleaner.

Miss Oyl is my goil, when on shore,
As her body's so hard to ignore.
You can feel the sensuality
Of ideal cylindricality:
Twenty-four twenty-four twenty-four.

In Tehran, needy Cy found a way
To get cash, save a life, the same day.
On his flank, there's a scar,
And he drives a new car.
Sell a kidney: win-win, some would say.

The camel's nose here is control:
It enlarges the government's role.
Though the bill seems benign,
Enforcement by fine
Is a bureaucrat's ace in the hole.

The literal target of Morta
Is likely to be your aorta.
Losing blood from your ticker
Will kill you much quicker,
A process that's slicker (well sorta).

Barcelona,  as tourists agree—
By the Mediterranean Sea—
Is historically fine
And a good place to dine,
In old Spain, where the street views are free.

A clown bike can have great appeal
At a circus. The kiddies will squeal
In delight at a clown,
With his painted-on frown,
On a bike with an off-center wheel.

A garter for arms helps relieve
You from tugging your unrolling sleeve.
These armlets are cute,
And they sell well, to boot:
Make them gifts on the next Christmas Eve.

Today's clash was a bloody one, clearly;
Both sides in the battle paid dearly.
Will they ever be able,
At the bargaining table,
To talk to each other sincerely?

The calcium phosphates include:
One we use when we're baking our food;
One that's earning its props
Helping fertilize crops;
One our bones and our teeth have accrued.

A proton was learning about
Antiprotons and wondered, in doubt,
Just what would ensue
If they mated, these two—
Each would cancel the other one out.

When Sumerian court was in session,
The recorders had quite a profession:
The cuneiform way
Was a true feat of clay,
And the scribes made a lasting impression.

Fifty-fifty: an equal-sized hit,
Half and half, no excess, not a bit,
And a term you can use
To describe win and lose
With the same probability split.

My life was a mess—full of stress;
I was headed for Hell, more or less,
Till that night, at a dance,
When we met, found romance.
Happy chance! 'Twas fortuitousness, Tess.

Depression-type storage is rain
That ditches or holes might retain
Until lost to the sun —
Smallish pools that don't run
To a river or sea; there's no drain.

Who did it? It's so hard to tell
But the odor is making life hell.
Hope that sooner than later
The doors to this 'vator
Will be opened to air out the smell.

With valleys and hillscapes most stark,
South Dakota is making its mark.
Its hoodoos and canyons
Are windswept companions,
In Badlands, the National Park.

Celebriousness! Yes, I'm eternal!
I'll light up the heavens nocturnal!
When you see how I fly
Far above you so high,
You'll remember my name in your journal.
 
(Remember! Remember! Remember! Remember!)

An abolisher strives to be rid
Of the habits and such we're amid.
"They're just wrong; status quo
Needs a change.  They must go!
Their continuance let us forbid."

Tell me, why must you top what I do?
Is your 'second best' complex why you
Pull a face, disagree,
Go one better than me?
If that's so, it won't work, Number Two.

I'm unveiling a small dental plaque.
It reads: "In memoriam: lack
Of good brushing and floss
Ended up with the loss
Of my teeth at the front and the back."

Here's a ballad in tribute to drilling mud:
Very few of us find it a thrilling mud,
But when drill bits get hot,
Down the well this stuff's shot—
It's a chilling as well as a filling mud.

Betty shot her old husband today.
He's still breathing, though, happy to say.
He'd been out chasing skirts
And was shot where it hurts:
She got him right in the toupee.

Bette caught Douglas last night in mid-hug
With Maureen, who was cute as a bug.
His response? A mere shrug,
But his wife's a real thug.
That's why Doug caught a slug in the rug.

You won't guess what I saw just last night:
An actinomyxidian fight.
 No, they're not just big germs,
 But they're things that eat worms.
You should see how these parasites bite!

It just makes me livid, said Ross.
The team's passing is not worth a toss.
When Celtic are playing
At Rangers, start praying
To God for a half-decent cross.

Cross Darth Vader with activist Nader,
And you'll get Brady Gray, the day trader.
Seems he started out mildly,
Then traded quite wildly.
He'll soon be a corporate raider.

Oh boy, am I down in the dumps!
My ardor for politics slumps.
Why I'm low? I'll be terse:
Just whose character's worse —
Is it Hillary Clinton's or Trump's?

You needn't feel fear and grow pale,
As this creature is very small-scale.
Not a pest like a morpion,
The tiny false scorpion
Won't sting—has no stinger or tail.

In a series of ancient migrations,
Certain Celts put down roots in locations
That used to be Phrygian.
Aggressive? A smidgen!
These bullies were called the Galatians.

Using cerium oxide's the last
Step in polishing mirrors.  It's cast
On the surface and ground
Nice and smooth all around.
It removes nicks and scratches so fast!

"The Bible is one of those places
Where little-known people's disgraces
Are lurid, and drink
Often causes a stink,"
So says Alemeth, covering his traces.

There's a rope from a spike in the ice
To a bell-ringing trigger device.
When the breakup begins,
Then the closest bet wins.
Use a river for gambling? No dice!

Fast asleep, here's how quickly she's woken:
An intruder, without a word spoken,
Grabbed some cash (found his mark)
But then tripped in the dark,
And a lamp and the silence were broken.

Their idol has now lost a leg or two;
Beneath it, they drink up a keg or two.
It's lost all its powers,
Just sits there and glowers.
It's disdeified—knocked down a peg or two.

One snake round a rod: See it twine.
It's our founder Asclepius' sign.
The caduceus (made
Double-snaked) is for trade,
Smooth-tongued tricks — not a healer's design.

There's a feeling I just cannot hide:
With my mouth opened up side to side
I look like an ape,
Full of fear, mouth agape,
When the dentist says "Now, open wide."

We abandon ambition and goals
And obey our great leader.  Our roles
Are as doctrine adherents.
Don't run interference.
This "cult," as you call it, saves souls.

Through the treetops, their howls will relay.
South American monkeys are they —
Sometimes called alouatte,
If you'd like to do that.
Alouatta's more common, I'd say.

The cloudless sky's bursting with light,
And is bluer than blue, and so bright.
So I'd best not complain:
"It's too hot. Where's the rain?"
Or my friends might just shoot me on sight.

Quick and drastic's the drop in the price
Of this stock.  Take your broker's advice:
"Bottomed out (at its nadir),
Buy now.  What comes later
May favor this roll of the dice."

And now, as you're all so insistent:
I shall sever in half my assistant!
So, lie down my dear...
Here's the saw... have no fear!
(Hmm. Her ribcage is rather resistant.)

Let someone manhandle my spine?
I'm afraid I'll politely decline,
As I shun chiropractic.
I guess that this tactic
For your spine is fine—but not mine!

An embarrassment of riches, I'd say:
Wear my clothes once, then toss them away.
But I sing, I'm a star;
The whole world's my bazaar,
So I splurge every prodigal day.

The cabbies drove Fiats all day,
Speeding here, racing there, the whole way
In an eight-car formation.
At night, relaxation:
Living fast in a small cabaret.

They have damaged my crops more than slugs—
Doryphora, plant-eating bugs!
My potatoes once thrived.
Since these beetles arrived,
Yields are ruined by arthropod thugs.

Your investments include prostitution.
With some luck, you avoid prosecution.
Business seldom is slow,
So they owe you some dough.
That's your capital gains distribution.

Will you tell me now, how did it feel
When your lover confessed she's disleal?
It burned like hot oil
To learn she's disloyal
And six hundred years old!  That's surreal.

A soul patch, the tiniest beard,
Is when all facial hair has been sheared
'Cept for one dinky thatch
'Neath your lip. When this patch
Is a chin strip, the chin tip is neared.

There's a sign on the house that says: Please
Stay Away—but I take out my keys,
And I open the door.
She lies sprawled on the floor;
She's collapsed. I get queasy and freeze.

Daily bread: what we need to subsist.
We still lack it, and here's why we're pissed:
Lord, we faithfully say
Your Lord's Prayer every day
And for daily bread pray.  Please assist!

I'm a loyal, proud first-generation
French lady. My mum is Croatian.
She married my dad,
An Australian lad.
(They're citizens, via migration.)

Geoinformatics addresses location
And data whose interrelation
Is graphically shown
As a map, which I'm prone
To prefer to the raw information.

I can see the world's going to hell
In a handbasket, yet when I tell
All my neighbors, they say,
"There's Cassandra; oy vey!"
Pitching truth is a very hard sell!

Eddie Cantor was famous, I've read,
For hilarious things that he said.
Five sweet daughters had he,
But his wife—who was she?
I'd'a asked him myself but he's dead.

What I mean when I say I'm "bummed out"?
No, my backside's not hanging about.
I mean I'm dejected.
We'd sex unprotected —
And now I'm infected, you lout!

Brontosaurus, Seanconnery, Tea,
Bonk, Millosevich—what can these be?
Bobhope, Pecker, Daveclark—
Are you still in the dark?
So are they. Click this link and you'll see.

I've employed a young housemaid named Peggy.
Her habits are dirty—so dreggy—
That I guess I must fire her.
Oh, why did I hire her?
(My face feels a tiny bit eggy.)

Your decurionate wants a repair;
That's your office, no need to despair.
You're in charge of ten guys,
So just get the supplies
And command them re when, what and where.

Bad's not bad, though their spelling's the same,
But the word used before a town's name—
Speak the "a" as an "ah"—
Means a spring or a spa
With some balneological claim.

Your fumbling attempts to impress
Show incompetence, lack of finesse.
Here's advice you should heed:
Boil the eggs that you need.
Then your juggling won't leave such a mess.

The Ibo, a tribe in Nigeria,
Were widely despised as inferior.
When Biafra seceded,
Supplies were impeded,
So closing the last cafeteria.

She said, "Bon appétit."  (That's a greeting
To those who're about to start eating.)
"Enjoy what I made"
She had meant.  I'm afraid,
Though, her purpose she wound up defeating.

What I do is evangelization:
I convert folks regardless of station.
"Choose the Christian way;
Read the gospel, and pray!
Can you manage a modest donation?"

A trainman, asleep at the switch,
Had been reading.  That son of a bitch
Failed at switching the tracks.
His attention was lax,
Costing lives with two trains in a ditch.

Depressurize Janie's champagne?
Or the cabin one finds on a plane?
Or a weather balloon
Tracking June's first monsoon?
By removing the gas? That's insane!

A dream team—ideal combination
Of talents in smooth operation—
Whether athletes or lawyers,
Brings joy to employers.
They're models of pure dedication.

"A desktop computer's so small
And so cheap that plain folks, one and all,
Have a personal computer."
So said my old tutor.
Now I've one in my purse. Hold that call.

I once knew a generous man
Who supported the whole of his clan.
Seems he struggled and worked
While his relatives shirked,
And they smirked as they worked on a tan.

Death by lethal injection or hanging,
Or a firing squad's dawn bang-bang-banging,
Or electric-charged chairs —
Our crime matches theirs.
I'd pick prison and moral haranguing.

It's been true ever since I was young:
I'm apivorous, so I've been stung
On my fingers and thumbs
And my lips and my gums—
But those bees taste so sweet on my tongue!

When we organize similar start-
of-word sounds, we alliterate. Part
Of the writer's technique,
Used in jest while we speak,
It suggests, some surmise, we're sure smart.

Of course, man, acourse means "of course",
As I see in my Oxford-made source.
It is also quite true:
It means "naturally", too.
(Acourse, this is no tour de force.)

Desalination:  it works without fault,
And  the money pours straight to our vault.
While fresh water creation
Might well save the nation,
We're stuck with these huge piles of salt.

Re your brainwave: awake and alert's
When your brain's beta rhythm in hertz
Measures somewhere between
Twelve and thirty to mean
It's okay, and some worries averts.

"Does my liking agnostics seem odd?
Well, at least these folk don't give the nod
To beliefs that induce
Men, with me their excuse,
To slaughter each other," says God.

I hope autograph seekers don't mind
That my name's automatically signed.
That robotic device
Called an autopen's nice.
Best of all, it leaves hand cramps behind.

I have apnea; breathing's a chore.
Till my airway collapses, I snore.
Then all noises will cease
Till my brain sends release
With a gasp, and I'm breathing once more!

The deuteroplasm (the yolk
In an egg) helps sustain, or to stoke,
As it constantly feeds
The protoplasm's needs,
Which nutrient lack would provoke.

Since the Biblical Alphaeus sired
An apostle who wrote and inspired,
His singular fame's
Being father to James,
Whose epistle's renowned and admired.

"An air miss?" The pilot's protesting,
"It was three hundred metres—you're jesting."
But consider the speed—
It's a danger indeed,
And in safety you should be investing.

How much salt in a teaspoon's a dash?
Kitchen mavens know this in a flash.
Twice a pinch—that's a clue
And four smidgens would do.
Overdoing can cause tastes to clash.

An ambitious ex-rancher prayed, "Please,
Make me top apiarian." He's
A success as of late,
And he brags, "Life is great.
I've a million or more head of bees!"

Far too often, your nightmares in bed
Lead to flailing with slaps to my head.
Since you wave energetically,
Swinging frenetically,
I'll sleep on the sofa instead.

More canvas! We must have more sail!
Grab this wind and I swear we can't fail.
See the genoa fill?
Always gives me a thrill.
If we hold thirty knots, we prevail.

I am music, to soothe savage breast,
Calm your jittery nerves, let you rest.
I can lower your pulse,
For I'm here to demulce —
It's my job, dude. It's what I do best.

There's no bounds to your crudity, sir.
Your vulgarity's causing a stir.
You're coarse, and you're rude,
But you've seized on the mood
Of the voters; that's what they prefer.

She was born right where Pisces meets Aries,
So her aspect, her character, varies.
A cusp child's confusing.
The stars do the choosing:
She's careful, or flying with fairies.

Here's my counterconditioning tool:
I've been swimming each day in the pool
To help conquer the fear
(Idiotic, it's clear)
That I'll drown in a bucket of drool.

We had said to the kidnappers, "Please!
Our young son has a kidney disease!"
Still, we met their demands
And he's back in our hands.
Now our minds are completely at ease.

Counterbattery fire destroys
The artillery someone deploys
To bombard from a distance,
Away from resistance.
It sure makes a hell of a noise.

Horace Fletcher said chewing was key.
The word fletcherize then came to be.
He said, "Nature will castigate
Those who don't masticate."
"Chew liquids as well," was his plea.

He's collapsed, and can't budge—not a fraction,
Cataplectic defines the reaction.
He's just seen her. It's her!
She's come back; he can't stir—
Till a part of him springs into action.

The delineament of your features
Is a challenge for students and teachers.
Though Picasso and Braque
Had no lack of the knack,
Neither drew The Attack of the Creatures.

While camping one day, in the fog,
I rested my feet on a log.
An acrasiomycete
Left slime on that dry seat—
Nevermore will I camp near a bog!

The veggie called celery's stringy
And greenish and chewy and clingy.
It gets stuck in my teeth
Both above and beneath
So I'd rather eat some other thingy.

The grains are well sorted and rounded.
Into cross-beds and ripples they're mounded.
Quartz arenite formed
Where the sand was once warmed:
On a beach, turned to stone, waves once pounded.

To bring nameplates of finest enamel back,
Mohammad first had to untrammel Bac,
His bactrian "truck",
To transport, with good luck,
All those plates to his clients on camelback.

A young student held views that were hawkish.
His social skills? Awfully mawkish.
"Golly, let's hatch a plan
For invading Iran!"
His Harvard rep: "Dude's kinda dawkish."

While this could be regarded as quaint,
When I'm hurt, it's a massive constraint.
I get breathless and dizzy,
Since, quiet or busy,
All hospitals make me feel faint.

"Jesus Christ resurrected?  Get out!
What's this nonsense you're talking about?"
Thomas asked.  "I demand
To bear witness first-hand.
Till I see for my own self, I'll doubt."

For the pain that you feel in some part
Of your body, for remedy start
Out by taking these pills
To help lessen your ills:
Take two aspirins. (Good, too, for your heart!)

Calm intruder — majestic mute swan:
Regal bearing on pond (not on lawn).
Seldom flies, often swims,
Sometimes landing in lims.
Mum's the word, both at dusk and at dawn.

According to Justice O'Connor,
Academicianship's truly an honor.
She's a law school post-grad
And, as well, she has had
Many other degrees heaped upon her.

You've bitten the hand that just fed you.
You should have been grateful.  Instead, you
Rebuffed generosity —
Such animosity!
Never again.  I misread you.

Two cowpokes rode bareback. The twain
Later got off and rested. The rain
Must have slickened their steeds,
'Cause a slipp'ry stud leads
To tumbles, a broke back, or sprain.

My commonplace book's full of notes
And thrilling and wonderful quotes
That soar like an eagle.
McKuen and Segal
Get two of my "best author" votes.

Bert the burglar will sell off the best
Of his haul, while discarding the rest;
And the knock-on effect
Of his crimes? He'll collect
Lots of cash: he will feather his nest.

All last year, Johnson's pitching was hot.
As a batter, he homered a lot.
You would think effort pays,
But next season? No raise!
His deservingness didn't mean squat.

"He was killed, but was English," I whine.
"Murder needs Norman bloodlines like mine."
There was lots of resentment
About my presentment
Of Englishry. Yes, but no fine.

How I wish my antenna was turned
To your face when you seemed so concerned.
But my mind's exclusivity,
Slim directivity,
Brought me the scorn that I earned.

The game warden gave me a ticket
Cuz I shot up a bear in a thicket —
I had broken the law.
Well, I cut off a paw
And I told him the place he could stick it.

To my students: it falls upon you
To achieve what I ask you to do.
That's your mandate, your station,
Your job, obligation —
Complain, blow it off, and you're through.

There's a guy on the ground in distress,
And his ankle's all swollen—a mess!
He's in pain, I'm afraid,
Though I'm giving first aid
(That I learned in first grade, I'll confess).

Consider the tiny arcella:
A semi-transparent old fellah.
With his tough outer skin
He's amoebic within,
And he looks like a little umbrella.

Quacked a duck, who once lived in a park,
"I'm so near-sighted when it's near dark.
That's at least my excuse;
I had hoped for a goose,
But was doing it just for a lark."

Mel's a spy, and I know very well
He has government secrets to sell.
Though I've paid a large sum,
He's clammed up and become
Dumbly mum; Mel's unwilling to tell.

Why on earth are CDs packed so tight?
You can't hear them without a huge fight.
When you buy a CD
Then your plight is to free
That damn disc. It might take you all night.

When there's thunder and lightning outside,
An astrapophobic will hide.
At the first flash and boom,
He'll go straight to his room,
Where he'll wait for the storm to subside.

On a watch, there's a way you can tell
When the battery nears EOL:
If the second hand moves
Somewhat slower, it proves
Pretty soon you will bid it farewell.

The future's not present nor past.
If you wait, it will get here at last,
But it then will be now
(Quite a trick, you'll allow),
But not never. Ain't English a blast?

Of Brahmans and bovines they prattle;
They even speak beef in Seattle.
On the range I don't roam—
The Big Apple's my home.
I'm a man who's Manhattan (no cattle).

Two Cowpers, each William—how grand!
One a bard, one a surgeon whose hand,
While dissecting the penis,
Unearthed (just between us)
What aptly is called Cowper's gland.

By by all means, I mean: "That's a yes!
It's a certainty, no need to guess."
By by no means, conversely,
I mean, somewhat tersely:
"No way! Not at all!" — nothing less.

Altruistic? Old Farmer La Farge?
I don't think so. His heart's not so large.
He tells ramblers like me,
"Stroll my meadows — they're free!"
But that's bull, for his bulls always charge.

My grandmother's eighty and loves
To wear none but the finest of gloves.
In her box she has several,
Made of kid that's called cheveril,
With the color and softness of doves.

When the soloist failed to appear,
I was asked to play something by ear.
My extemporisation
Received an ovation,
Backed up by an ear-splitting cheer!

Our excuses were often quite lame,
But today we weren't even to blame.
"You boys broke what encloses
That painting of roses."
Together we cried: "It's a frame!"

The Conservative Party are hoary—
Somewhat stodgy, but more to their glory.
While they may be old hat,
I applaud them for that;
You might say I'm appreciatory.

Their filial duty's the cause
Of years of their lives set on pause.
While they looked after Dad
And then Mum, they both had
Son-and-daughterly love through their chores.

Though my dive shop resembles a dive,
I've got gear to keep divers alive.
No, I didn't invent it;
I sell, trade or rent it.
And I stock all you'll need to survive.

Freud's impulse toward violence, destrado,
Runs rampant in those with bravado.
It's an anti-libido;
Destruction's the credo
(Like I feel when I watch The Mikado).

When a metaphor, grossly inflated,
Makes a subtlety sound understated,
Then the stoniest ear
Finds the meaning is clear,
Borne by words not just laden but freighted.

Most knots are revered for their function
And a steadfast, rock-solid main junction.
But the bowknot is tops
Among dandies and fops,
And it's worn without any compunction.

Now we come to our best item yet.
Place a bid on this nice bassinet!
It's authentic Peruvian
Antediluvian
Wicker. And look, it's still wet!

The dermoblast, smart little cell,
Forms deep skin, where the blood vessels dwell.
It won't produce eyes,
Or the muscles in thighs,
But the dermis it makes very well.

You ask, "Why, why-o-why, why-o-why-o
Did Trump pardon old Sheriff Arpaio?"
To Contempt-of-Court Joe,
Trump believes — wrongly so! —
That the rule of law doesn't applai-o.

During Lent, Brother Kent told the pastor,
"I'm a pious and God-fearing faster.
No meat, only fish
Comes these days on my dish,
Such as herring, or carp, or a castor."

The thallus of Fucus is burned
To smoke fish on some islands, or turned
And plowed under the dirt
So potatoes are fert-
ilized. Bladderwrack's not to be spurned!

Devastation engenders much grief,
For of land, life and limb, it's a thief.
Often, anguish and pain
Will be all that remain,
Since from ruin there's no quick relief.

This oddly shaped stone in my hand,
Called a ben-ben, can help understand
Egypt's genesis myth.
It's the rock where, forthwith,
Primal waters first yielded to land.

Aerobatics for stunt pilot Eddie
Were heart-stopping, harebrained, and heady.
With his very last breath
He said, "I've cheated death
'Cause I've grabbed it before it was ready."

When Sue viewed, via test ultrasonic,
Her fetus in sac chorionic,
She burst into cheers:
"He's got Mickey Mouse ears!"
"Yes, indeed," beamed the doc. "He's iconic."

If I told you I wanted dimission
I'd mean that I had an ambition
To go or depart,
But I know I can't start,
Whilst lacking your leave and cognition.

The debate gave ideas an airing,
But the candidates' manner and bearing
And their form of address
Mattered more to the press,
Not to mention the clothes they were wearing.

Mariah hates Nikki? No matter.
The loathing draws slurs from the latter.
Are the barbs from Minaj
A deliberate barrage
Or just prattle and mere "Idol" chatter?

I recall with some pain my first campout.
It had rained, it was cold, it was damp out.
I woke up, had to pee;
It was night, couldn't see
'Cause the wind blew my kerosene lamp out.

Though his shirt has a staff sergeant's rank on it,
Is he really a soldier? Don't bank on it!
His hair is too long
And his ribbons are wrong.
Mon Dieu! I would not bet a franc on it.

Said a Jellicle cat named Macavity,
Well-known for his crimes and depravity:
"The mean point of matter
For a jewel-case or platter
Is known as the center of gravity."

Afternoons are the best time of day.
I eat, then I rest, then I play.
I sit out on the chaise
And I happily gaze
At all that is passing my way.

Young Vesper, dear Zypher's big bro,
In Oxford's library laid low,
His snoring so loud
Drew quite a crowd,
Till wake-up bells started to blow!

Of the five on each foot in a row,
It's the largest and innermost toe.
For this reason I would
Say that big toe is good;
As a name, it is most apropos.

Under Dubya, the high price of gas
Had the media riding his ass.
Gas went down.  Now we're back
Where we were.  No attack
On Obama.  He's given a pass.

First a buzz, soon a cheer, then a roar:
A crescendo that rose with the score.
With each fearless attack,
Our boys clawed their way back.
Then, a gasp: they collapsed, as before.

Chubby bread lumps should all bite the dust.
Serve me long loaves of brown, crunchy crust:
A baguette or French stick,
Skin as hard as a brick,
Is my dinnertime go-with, a must.

There was an old man of Herne Bay
Who invited his nephew to stay.
He said, "Come for a week,"
But that geek — what a cheek! —
Stayed for more than a year and a day.

Doctor Jack prods my midriff and tuts.
Enteralgia's driving me nuts.
Is Jack Daniels symbolic,
For this alcoholic,
Of colic, or pain in the guts?

Once the pirate ship started to burn,
She attempted escape with a turn.
'Run the bow-chasers out,'
Came the Admiral's shout,
'And we'll give her a slap on the stern!'

An em-dash can often replace
A parenthesis, bracket, or brace.
So you could—if you chose—
Have those symbols en-close
An aside in these dashes' em-brace.

The agony aunt sucks her pen,
And mutters "Oh Lord, tell me when
Will these virgins like "Midge" and all
Ask an original
Question? (I'll just count to ten.)"

So transparent and bald-faced, she lies,
And her blatant dishonesty cries
To high heaven for righting.
Every friendship she's blighting—
Telling whoppers, she sure takes the prize.

Whatever you think are his charms,
Some things should be ringing alarms.
All the loot that he's got —
Does he pay? He does not.
He's deep pockets and very short arms.

You think you're just ever so clever
Knowing aa is lava. However,
Double-a's have their ways —
Some can stand for long a's
Or mean "stream," or an obsolete "ever."

Here's a cuculoid sort of a bird
From the family of cuckoos, I've heard.
Called the roadrunner, it
Doesn't lay eggs and split;
It will raise its own chicks, undeterred.

Oh, such similar words that there be:
Deformity (formity, de-)
Versus (formity dif-):
Like a savory whiff,
But the de- isn't pretty to see.

My sousaphone broke near in two,
When a crack left the valves bent askew.
I was ready to quit
'Til a friend fixed the split
With a smile and a small tuba glue.

The priest smiles benignly and bows
To Miss Tibbs, whom he's keen to arouse;
There's a challenge for him!
(Though his prospects look slim,
For just looking is all she allows.)

Over dishwater, dishwashers mull
Whether punch bowls could fracture a skull,
And if sudsy wet ladles
Could scoop babes from cradles.
(And dishwater's said to be dull?)

Ancient Greeks ate their meals while reclining,
Spending hours in that way, gaily dining.
Did their elbows grow tired?
Was a pillow required?
And did spines later on need aligning?

On potatoes and salads, I shake
Textured vegetable protein to make
'Em taste better.  I savor
That bacon bits flavor.
Who cares if the bacon is fake?

Da Vinci, that wonderful fella,
Couldn't always produce a top sella.
As a genius, he's hailed,
Yet he frequently failed—
Ever try his spaghetti umbrella?

It's with dissatisfaction you rate
Your own body, by size and by weight.
You see flaws, nothing right,
In that negative light,
But through my eyes, it's clear you look great.

Here's a message from our advance guard.
It says the next village is charred!
The rebels marched through it—
There's nothing left to it—
I'm angry to see it so scarred.

I'm a cock-of-the-rock from Peru,
Known best by my orange red hue.
My distinctive fanned crest
Helps me lek with the best,
As we court a young female or two.

Our parties could leave you aghast;
We all drank like each day was our last.
Now I've heard the Big Bang
Was a helluva thang —
Not compared to our blasts from the past.

Said the elderly farmer, "It's fine,
It's repaired to my own grand design—
Nailed together and bound
And held well off the ground
By the finest of old binder twine."

The Marxists are back; how I've missed 'em!
And they're looking for kids, to enlist 'em.
"We must share with these youths
Anticapitalist truths
So they don't wind up trapped in your system."

There was gold in the Sutter Mill  mud,
And those nuggets stirred gold-seekers'  blood.
As the word spread, they came
Quickly staking a claim,
And one, two, thousands more in a flood.

In the hospital, when I was sick,
I'd felt hopeless but cheered up real quick.
I was helped by the types
Who wore pink and white stripes—
All those teen volunteers did the trick.

Slurring earsh (field of stubble), I stumble.
"Ush" or "ash", "ersh" or "eersh"? What a jumble!
Is it "eersh", like (wheat) ear,
Or like earth (which it's near)?
If I'm asked, I'll "um...uhh...er...sh" mumble.

A role model, always reliable,
John was one of our best, exemplifiable,
Till he came into work
With that gun — went berserk!
That he'd changed overnight's undeniable.

The prime message she left on our phone
Was to say she would play her trombone.
Her digressional words
Ranged from cooking to birds —
So off-topic — a world of her own!

Old Miss Farthing shows plenty of mettle;
Though her health's not so good, with her kettle
She'll provide you with tea.
Those who visit agree
She's a fighter, and looks in fine fettle.

If brain cells were cash, I would bet
That this guy would be deeply in debt.
He's a 45C,
Which, between you and me,
Means one chromosome short of a set.

A ninety-pound weakling once said,
"You bully!  Kick sand and you're dead!"
But until he built muscles
To win future tussles,
Charles Atlas's threats caused no dread.

When they execute Uncle Abe's will
Devastavit occurs: Cousin Phil
Gets the house and the land—
Surely not what Unc planned?
And for me? Just the damn lawyer's bill.

A young psychic perceived with clairvoyance
That the girl of his dreams was a boy once.
"Not to worry," said he,
"I was also a she,
But I found it a monthly annoyance."

In Kyoto, a beautiful geisha
Developed severe dyssebacia.
Skin scaly and red,
She took to her bed
Till her doctor prescribed echinacea.

If in public, a gal's been molested,
In India, then she's protested,
She's been eve-teased, and may
Have revenge (in a way),
As the eve-teaser might be arrested.

Let us stand by Mike's aged eighty-eight:
That piano he plays (loud, not great).
Let us croon — sing along,
With the harmony wrong,
Those old "June-moon-spoon" tunes until late.

I have to admit I'm a man
Who likes lasses who have a big can.
But before I engage,
I make sure they're of age.
(Winding up in the can's not my plan.)

Abracadabra's a phrase
Of magicians, although in past days
It was thought to aid healing
When worn while ill feeling.
The necklace would cure your malaise.

There's a note on my door: BRB.
"Be right back" is the message for me.
Only thing I don't know:
When on earth did he go?
'Cause a time when he's back, I can't see.

The brain trust that runs our division
Likes to manage by threat and derision.
They're the stockholder's whores
And they're planning new scores
While they screw us by corporate decision.

A botherer bothered and vexed
Me when workshopping part of my text.
He sang in his song
That my text was too long,
And "An idiot you are!" he railed next.

The American West is defined
By a series of peaks well aligned.
Adams, Baker and Hood,
These Cascades have long stood
With grace, by the ages refined.

Little Timmy is cranky and cross,
And Thanksgiving, he thinks, is a loss.
But Sis thinks he's jerky
Refusing his turkey
When served without cranberry sauce.

I dreamt about Bake Off last night.
Paul Hollywood scoffed at my plight,
But sweet Mary Berry
Said, "Cheer up, be merry,
Your tarts will all turn out just right."

Hail "Gustavo the Great" Dudamel —
Gifted maestro now doing quite well.
From L.A. to Milan,
Georges Bizet to Don Juan,
Just how high will he fly?  Who can tell?

I'm quite proud of my art, and I sell
My drawings. I do rather well.
I draw handkerchiefs, purses
And watches (and curses:
"Stop! Pickpocket! Damn you to hell!").

"If we're caught, we'll go down with a thud,
And our names will be dragged through the mud,"
Said a thief to his friend.
"This will surely not end
With a fine. The D.A.'s after blood."

A desponding young painter cried, "Pooh!
To myself must I always be true?
Oh, I'd never get used
To my palette reduced
To a dismally few shades of blue!"

Moaned a man, "My poor feet are mistreated,
So perhaps I had better be seated."
Then he slumped on his ass
Like a limp inert mass,
His conversion to dead weight completed.

The new basketball player's a hunk,
And he just made a lovely slam-dunk.
It's a stuff shot, a dunk shot,
A jump-and-kerplunk shot.
Now let's all have a ball and get drunk.

Though your manner's polite, nice and mild,
If you don't eat your cabbage, my child,
Big bad bashi-bazouks
Will charge down with sharp hooks.
You'll be carried off into the wild.

My antejentacular rise
In the morning should be no surprise,
But the thing that amazes?
My breakfast most days is
A burger with soda and fries.

Low to the ground as it goes,
The centipede uses its nose
To find insects to eat,
While an army of feet
Moves what looks like a flexible hose.

Acupuncturists talk of a force
Of great energy—well, where's its source?
They describe it as chi—
Tell me, what can that be?
Oh, invisible life force, of course!

The midwife was kind, had no malice,
And her tone was empathic, not callous,
But her message was trouble:
"Your newborn has double
Male genitals—yes, it's diphallus."

Lenore may be skinny, it's true.
Her ballet shoe, though? Size 22!
When her partner's offstage,
Still her act's all the rage
'Cause she dances her own pas de deux.

I saw Femme and I liked it a lot.
Just four lines and then look what you've got:
It's a lady's bare butt!
Is that genius, or what?
But "Picasso"? Nine lines and a dot!

In Athens I overheard speak
A fraternity man, a math geek.
Bawled the brash, fratty guy,
"Delta epsilon phi—"
I cut in. "Is that math, frat, or Greek?"

Achymous?  Now, what could that mean?
Webster's says "without chyme."  Well, that's lean.
So I then took the time
To look up the word chyme.
And its meaning is gross and obscene.

Air-to-ground involves bombs, no mistake,
But permit me to joke, for flight's sake:
Pilots' wheeled "air-to-grounding"
Should equal (no rounding)
The number of take-offs they make.

"We've accomplished our mission," he claimed,
But the war in Iraq stays untamed.
Long before this address,
Bush's credibleness
Disappeared. He remains unashamed.

They're called garrets because they're "upstairs"
(Like where poor artists starve, have affairs):
Pockets (fobs) — stitched in vests,
Mooring watches to chests
Of rich gents, with their graces and airs.

As a carpenter, Alice was dippy,
Making shelves that were slapdash and slippy.
Now her cupboards have crashed,
Leaving crockery smashed.
She's a hopelessly ham-fisted chippy.

Holy Christopher carried Our Lord
Through the river the child couldn't ford.
He calmed travelers' fears,
Only now it appears
He's mere legend and shan't be adored.

The judge on the bench had his way,
So you're headed for Botany Bay.
New South Wales is a gaol
That can make a heart fail—
Say goodbye to your life, not g'day.

Added games are more tiresome than clever.
Now the Series is lasting forever.
This Fall Classic's just ending
And snow is impending.
Frozen baseball's a foolish endeavor.

Man o' War has a get, race fans know,
That will frequently win, place, or show.
As they say, "Blood will tell!"
His descendants race well,
And for years they have raked in the dough.

You're a swindler, a blackleg, a crook,
And you've tried every trick in the book.
You'd ensure that you win;
Beat it now — save your skin,
And just pray to be let off the hook.

If President Trump died today,
With the dissonant drumbeat at play,
CNN and the rest
Would be awfully hard-pressed
To come up with some nice things to say.

This journal's first class; it costs plenty,
But it's read by well-bred cognoscenti.
I've submitted two pieces;
My disquiet increases.
They'll publish me, Deo volente.

I am losing my head 'cause I bedded
The princess before we were wedded.
For that rapture, the order
Is: "Stature, make shorter".
The guillotine's where I'll be headed.

The weatherman notes with a frown,
"The Air Quality Index is 'Brown.'
Since we don't support trees
But we love SUVs,
It's a cinch it'll only go down."

A bowler's economy rate:
Runs per over. He's going for eight?
That's expensive as hell—
Make him finish his spell!
Try a bowler whose rate's more sedate.

I've heard andropause now and again.
It's like menopause, only for men.
This malaise may arrive
Around age forty-five
And then last till one hundred and ten.

Every time that I sit down alone
Near the artwork of walled dry-laid stone,
Soon my spirit's imbued
With a mystical mood
And contentment that goes to the bone.

Let me tell of the swell magic spell
Of a well with a helluva smell
Where I yelled, on my knees,
In that valley with trees:
"Dear Adele, come, let's dwell in this dell!"

Sap that's petrified, amber's a gem
And also the name of a femme.
Hold these jewels up to light,
There's a chance that you might
See some flora or fauna in them.

Tonya gave me a token of love,
A favor, a porcelain dove
From a garter she wore.
The inscription it bore,
Enigmatic, was: "Heaven's above."

Yoda finds an alluvial fan:
From the canyonside, water once ran.
And when many fans merge,
Call the apron-like verge
Of deposits, bajada, he can.

"Subject A" is a substance abuser:
A crackhead, a speed freak, a boozer.
Though his chart says "In need"
And "At risk," it's agreed
It boils down to "this guy is a loser."

This weapon, a dagger-like blade,
Can be used by a rifle brigade.
As a tube in a heater,
It is peaceful, much neater:
Of such bayonets no one's afraid.

Bimonthly: I looked it up twice
Since it has dual meanings (how nice).
If it's journals I sought
Was it six that I bought,
Or (per year) twenty-four, for the price?

The government takes a good sum
From my paycheck each month.  Here you've come
Up requesting some dough
For your "cause."  Sorry, no.
Look, I gave at the office, you bum!

My boss (oh my God, what a jerk!)
Loves to pooh-pooh our limerick work.
He will get, oftentimes,
Apoplectic oe'r rhymes —
He gets far off his bean — goes berserk!

My home on the sea floor is magic,
But it seems that my life will be tragic:
The mermaids I woo
Will have nothing to do
With the bed (they're abyssopelagic).

This nine-foot-long flute angles 'round
Like the numeral 4, and its sound
Is two octaves below
Concert flutes. You should know
It's played standing, its foot on the ground.

That magnet's designed to attract,
But he's not just attractive, in fact,
Since he equally well
Can repulse and repel
If he's lacking in charm and in tact.

Dimetric: the shape of a stone,
How its crystalline structure is known.
The concept embraces
Quadrangular faces
Where two equal axes have grown.

Before there is wine, there is must.
Before there is love, there is lust.
This logical flow
Is everywhere, so
Before there are bunnies, there's dust.

We have ivy that covers the bricks.
It has feelers that cling to the nicks
In the mortar that's weak.
It sends creepers that seek
Any foothold—it grabs on and sticks.

Is he planning another campaign?
Shock-and-awe stuff all over again?
"Let's topple that man
Who's now running Iran!"
It is plain that the plan is insane.

A mysterious fellow named Liddle
Loved conversing in puzzle or riddle.
But is it a plus
To enigmatise thus?
Where's the ending, beginning, or middle?

An audio frequency's clear:
It's a sound that we humans can hear,
Like from chickens or choirs,
Or local town criers—
It's audible waves for our ear.

To the gallows, the convict was led,
And a noose was slipped over his head.
The trap door was released.
He cried cockles, that beast!
With a snap of his neck, he was dead.

This flick has me biting my nails;
The tension is right off the scales.
Rustling leaves in the dark,
A forlorn city park,
And the gore — I eat up these old tales.

There once was a hippie named Ian
Who wanted to be a Fijian.
When asked, "Why migrate
To this Commonwealth State?"
He just mumbled "Well, man, to be free, an..."

A toothbrush and toothpaste are cheap.
To your teeth, though, you don't give a bleep.
Now the dentinal section
Of your tooth needs correction—
This cavity's deep... deep... deep... deep...

While a short snappy statement has zing,
To a more wordy style I will cling:
"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah,
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah,
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah,
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah,
Blah blah blah, blah blah blah,
Blah blah blah, blah blah BLAH!"
(No, breviloquence isn't my thing.)

For this actor of loftiest rank,
We have all quite a great deal to thank.
Michael Crawford's his name,
TV/theatre's his game,
Playing Barnum, The Phantom, and Frank.

At the song with the bawdy refrain,
Flo embarrassed her husband again
When she shuffled and wriggled,
And snorted and giggled.
Groaned dad, "Your mum laughed like a drain!"

As a sculptor, Dossena sold many
Fine works, but for hardly a penny.
"He's a forger!" some cried.
"It's my dealers who lied,"
He replied. Now his fame? Hardly any.

When your cargo is ready to ship,
On per-pound cost you'll want a good grip.
Here's a hint you should heed:
A full carlot you'll need.
Fill the freight car and charges will dip.

My sewers are clogging in Plano,
And lava works better than Drano.
A steaming caldera
Might bring a new era.
I'd welcome a little volcano.

It's a tragedy. No one was thinkin'
Your spouse would be shot in a blink 'n'
John Wilkes Booth mar your night,
But we note with delight
That our play earned your laughs, Mrs. Lincoln.

After harvest, there's stubble called eddish:
Field of stalks, not quite dead, rather deadish.
Your look's hungry and lean,
So from this you may glean,
(Gaining grains) for your pains, morsels breadish.

The gaberdine folks wore in town
For protection when rain tumbles down,
In the old Middle Ages,
Say language source sages,
Meant, "type of loose cloak or a gown".

I ordered a blintz filled with jelly,
And some matzoh ball soup at this deli.
It was all so delicious,
I added knishes,
Judiciously filling my belly.

In matters of style, she's contrarian—
She's dressed like a dowdy librarian!
A designer who knows her
Insists she's a poser:
The ultimate attitudinarian.

Henry's "hurrying" gait—festination—
Is bringing him utter frustration.
It appears he may fall,
Or at least hit a wall.
Yes, it's Parkinson's. That's the causation.

My hubby's new hobby is verse:
Writing limericks—and, hey, it gets worse!
He's a master of rhyme
Who no longer has time
To play doctor while I'm playing nurse.

Controlled flight, they say, into terrain
Is a sure way to screw up a plane.
You're just flying along
As if nothing is wrong,
And then— CRASH! —all on board are chow mein.

I've two sons, and the elder's a fool,
While the younger is clever and cool.
I have moderate means,
And they're both in their teens,
So they go to a composite school.

Said Joe Croc to his friend, Allie Gator,
"Alas for Sam Shark in Decatur
With some lady named Beth,
Forced to fight to the death!"
"Poor Sam!" answered Al. "Gladiator."

He's the cockiest dude in the bay,
At the wheel of his red Chevrolet.
It is shiny and big,
So he's sure got the rig
To go pick up a girl for a... day.

Where's Sally? Has anyone seen her?
She has the most bubbly demeanor.
She's carefree and gay
With such nice things to say—
Finds her own grass is always the greener.

Michael knew it was wrong when he shot,
Killing John with that gun, did he not?
He, consciously, shamefully,
Acted most blamefully.
(Six months on probation he got.)

A small tab of some acid, a quick
Flight, a trip into space—what a kick!
I'm so zonked, really flying,
Out-of-sight, in-the-skying!
Hell or heaven, can't say—take your pick.

"My new coat," sighed Lenore, with remorse,
"Like the blanket you'd put on a horse,
Has been made of the stuff
That is scratchy and rough—
It's of dagswain, of grossness, of coarse!"

Do you need a mechanical part?
Cyberneticists study the art
Of connecting your mind
To machines, so go find
One for cyborg-style legs, arms, and heart.

There's an edge to this music, they say,
That puts girls in a family way.
Satan loves rock 'n roll.
Turn it off! Save your soul!
(That was then. We're much smarter today.)

Technicians debugging Mark II
Found that relays can fail when they chew
On an insect's abdomen.
This seems like an omen
Of software so buggy it's poo.

Would the Democrats find it a blessing
If their two top contenders stopped pressing
To be first and became
A merged team with one aim—
C-and-O,  their best skills coalescing?

Thirty winters — the span was a wreck,
So a bridge engineer went to check.
It needed new paint,
But his major complaint
Was the roadbed.  "Resurface the deck."

In circuitry, there's a design
In sensors that's top of the line.
No, that's not empty flattery—
CMOS saves battery
Power for slower decline.

Albert crepe once was worn to convey
That a loved one had now passed away.
It's a style now forgotten,
Of black silk and cotton,
And good to see gone, most would say.

Want some mouthwash, a strong oral rinse?
Maybe suck on a couple of mints,
'Cause our date's kiss of death
Is your horrible breath
(Halitosis).  It's making me wince.

You're too big for your britches, oh my!
I am taking you down from on high.
If you have the ability,
Show some humility.
Egotist! Eat humble pie.

"All these bindings will need to be picked;
Every chain and each rope I'll abstrict.
In this task, I'll not tarry,"
Escapologist Harry
Houdini remarked (seconds ticked).

Can one be both the best and the worst,
Widely cheered and then mockingly cursed?
First the rahs then the boos
Were received by Tom Cruise—
How quickly are fortunes reversed.

"Billionth (point, then eight zeros, then one)
Of a chance," she remarked, "we'll have fun."
I had to destroy it —
"You needn't enjoy it,"
I said, dropping odds down to none.

A covering letter makes sense.
It explains the attachments and, hence,
Should assist the receiver
Of info and leave her
More sure of the sender's intents.

Children learned how to read, long ago
From a hornbook; there's one in this show.
See the christcross ahead
Of the letters outspread?
It's a neat and complete christcross row.

Hegel taught dialectical thought.
Then materialism was brought
By Karl Marx. This solution
Sparked Red revolution:
Justice sought; theory wrought; class wars fought.

Adam chastised his wife for her slight.
"Evie, eating that apple's not right!"
"Don't scold me, my dear,
That cute snake made it clear
We'd gain wisdom, so here, have a bite!"

An arthropod's glad, when it's fightin',
To know its cuticula's chitin —
'Cause hard, outer layers
Stop arthropod slayers
Intendin' on scratchin' and bitin'.

Our starchy-food paraphernalia,
From Canada down to Australia,
Are made from materials
Of grasses, the cereals,
Scientifically called cerealia.

Said a seed to his guest, "I'm no louse,
And in general, it's best not to grouse,
But your thick, outer coat
Broke my best serving boat—
Doff your episperm, please, in this house!"

What's dysuria? A: Russian tea,
Or B: Feeling pain when you pee,
Or C: When you're sure
That his motives are pure.
Time is up. (Yes, the answer was B.)

A basilican church is called dromic
On account of its shape ergonomic;
It's based on the courses
They used to race horses—
I find that analogy comic.

My onerous daily corvée
Is a source of unease and dismay.
In addition to eating
And bathing, I'm beating
My brains out on limericks all day.

Though it isn't the word we would use,
She describes her career as danseuse,
As the swan she portrays
In her latest ballets
Tends to trip on the lace of her sheuse.

Back when biplanes and triplanes were king,
A cabane was a valuable thing.
It was mast-like, this shaft,
On the sides of those craft,
And was used for supporting the wing.

The word factoid is used different ways.
One meaning's "a statement or phrase
That's presumably phony."
Another's more tony:
"An interesting fact one might praise."

Since they faxed her this cold, pointed letter,
It's posted. We'll never forget her:
"You've been missing work chronically;
You're replaced electronically.
A machine won't play sick—and works better."

Want some Adam? Just walk up and say
To the dealerman, "MDMA,"
Or, if you've got the moxie,
Say, "Methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine," and be on your way.

I have fought off — and beaten — a shark.
I have hit the ball out of the park.
I have no flaws or vices.
I offer fair prices.
I modestly come to the mark.

Take four points (A to D) in a row;
Their cross ratio's easy to know:
It's AC × BD
Per AD × BC.
Turn your quiz in and then you can go.

"Having intercourse—something I'd like,
But it's years since I've been down that pike;
So I'm fearful that now
I've forgotten just how."
"It's okay; it's like riding a bike!"

My bank account's nice to behold
When it's black with its balance of 'gold'.
But when I'm in the red,
And I owe cash instead,
Then I'm blue, and my spending's on hold.

A biblioklept has just sinned,
And the bookseller's really chagrined.
This most bookish of crooks
Has run off with his books,
And it looks like they're Gone with the Wind.

Playing bridge? Feeling really astute?
Learn this rule: if you can, follow suit.
And so, what is your aim?
You must put down the same—
Spade, heart, diamond or club. No dispute!

"Don't you look at a king!  You're a cat!
Straight ahead's where your eyes should be at!"
"I can look where I please!
I'm as good as you!  Jeez!"
"It's latrine duty, son, just for that!"

We're measured by representations:
If we're male, exponential inflations.
Yes, we're judged by our cocks,
But, deceased, it's the box,
As fine caskets will upgrade our stations.

In The Case of the Lim'rick Cut Short,
The detective had this to report:
"I printed the piece,
And then called the police
With a clue, for the screen said

We're on tour with our baby son Ted
And a camp cot instead of a bed.
This morning, this camp cot
Was rather a damp cot,
And Ted's little butt was all red.

"You used to get picked on?  By who?"
"By a mean kid in school that I knew.
Then one day after class,
I just whomped on his ass."
"That's impressive!  Well, bully for you!"

If you're looking for diplomats, go
To a place in the city I know
Where ambassadors dwell.
They work there as well,
And they call the place Embassy Row.

Said a pretty soprano from Devon,
"When I hit a high B I'm in heaven."
Said the leader, "Big breath!"
She nodded, "Oh yeth,
And I've had them thinth I wath eleven."

To twist up long hair like a star,
One could use a barrette and go far.
But that cute little clip
Simply can't get a grip—
So in your case, let's use the whole bar.

For a shake that's the best that you've had,
Take two scoops of some ice cream and add
Some banana or berry,
Or chocolate or cherry;
Add milk and then blend it like mad.

There are critters out there in the hush —
Baby beasties that blend in the brush:
They don't dazzle like clowns,
But wear dun, grayish browns
(It could even prove deadly to blush).

What a sight for sore eyes to behold:
Tulip buds are about to unfold.
But by dawn's ray of light
Bambi'd left none in sight —
All devoured, if truth must be told.

Clean my wound and remove the detritus.
You will find I have diaphysitis
In my femur. The shaft
Is infected. You're daft
If you think that my pain's from arthritis.

Though they skate at a breathtaking pace,
The play comes to a halt at the face,
When the action is stopped
So the puck can be dropped —
Then it's back to the ice hockey chase.

A proponent of natural light,
Ansel Adams zoned in with pure sight.
His stark photos revealed
Nature's beauty concealed.
Nothing fancy, just plain black-and-white.

My mother has died. She is dead,
Passed away in the bath, not in bed.
She was just over eighty
And overly weighty.
Too much bathing will kill you, it's said.

If you know that you cannot but fail
('Cause you're travelling, sick or in jail)
To be present the day
When we say "aye" or "nay",
Send your absentee ballot by mail.

These expatriate delicatessens
Teach behavior-based, usable lessons:
Though folks move far away,
Tastes of home every day
Fend off homesickness—foods can be blessin's.

At the office, it looks a bit strange,
But these things are a fuss to arrange.
I brought some spare clothes
And everyone knows
After work I'll perform a quick change.

Certain things are horrific and ghastly.
They're ugly and scary and vastly
Corrosive, I find,
To the peace of my mind,
Like that video song by Rick Astley.

Hurry up and start moving your ass
A lot faster.  Don't give me no sass.
(You could speed up our take-off
By taking the brake off.)
Get the lead out.  Yo!  Step on the gas!

We're cutting you loose; you know why:
You've given our firm a black eye.
Keeping peace with our clients
Takes tact and some science,
Not shouting, "Go somewhere and die."

Between thick knotted branches I lie:
Staring up from this tree, I could fly.
Twisted limbs are ensnarled
With each other and gnarled
In a lattice that splinters the sky.

As a wood-turner I go berserk,
When a person finds fault with my work
Though it's flawlessly done:
Grooves or scratches? Not one!
(Such a critic is simply a berk!)

The brewmaster doesn't make wine,
Only beer that should taste quite divine.
So please don't delay.
Fill my mug up today.
A pint of your best will do fine.

She displayed so commanding a style,
Her opponents obeyed, rank and file.
Commandingly, she'd
Demand they agreed,
But (don't tell her) they thought she was vile.

To my allergist: "Why do I wheeze?
And why do I sniffle and sneeze?"
"A reaction," said he,
"To some sort of a tree
Or to thingies that float on the breeze."

The students are so argumentive,
What's needed is action preventive.
They don't need to fight
To settle what's right.
They really should be more inventive.

"Get out of the way, kids", yelled Dan,
"Dad can't see when he's backing the van:
There's a blind spot in back,
So let's stay off the track
And squeeze over as far as we can."

You can locate cyanobacteria
From the tropics to northern Siberia,
And they're not always blue,
Though with N, CO2,
And some moisture, their lives can't be drearier.

This love token holds special powers.
Hey guys, it stays potent for hours.
A bouquet holds the key
To scoring with me.
(But you won't with a cheap bunch of flowers!)

The Space Travel lectures would heighten
My students' bare knowledge, and brighten
Their vague understanding
Of each lunar landing,
For all that they'd hear would enlighten.

It isn't contagious, psoriasis,
But this kind of itch (sent to try us) is:
When hygiene's not followed
And worm eggs are swallowed
You end up with enterobiasis.

All my life, I have not understood
How to tell a bum deal from a good.
With each scheme I devise
I get stars in my eyes
And say, "This couldn't fail!"—but it could.

There's a color much loved, I've heard tell,
One to please any mademoiselle,
That is known as French blue.
It's their national hue,
Found on sports teams and racecars as well.

Arm candy's not something you'd eat,
Though for sure she's a sight that's quite sweet.
With this girl on your arm
You will charm with no qualm,
And your night on the town is complete.

Carter Beauford on drums sets the pace;
Stefan Lessard adds rhythm on bass.
Tinsley's fiddle will soar
With the woodwinds of Moore,
All while Dave sings the vocals with grace.

At the gallows, the killer's life's ending;
He is haughty and pompous, unbending.
As the priest murmurs grace,
The man plummets through space:
Condescending no more — con descending.

My mother's a cryonaut. Shrinking
From chemo, and hopefully thinking
That doctors to come
Will cure her, poor mum
Has been friz. Me, I'll pickle by drinking.

While you're lovely at lovemaking, pet,
It's, well, brief: I'm not finished just yet.
You're ingenious and deft;
Still, I'm feeling bereft
And crave epic, not light featurette.

Gertrude's gross, of great girth. She ain't pert.
How on earth should she fasten her skirt?
Would an eighty inch girdle
Gird Gert for this hurdle?
Engirting poor Gertie could hurt.

Carrot Rebel: shmooshed rootsh make the orange
For thish cheese, and the cowsh eat jusht forange
Like herbsh and shweet grash —
Never brewersh' (hic) mash.
I hope you don't find thish too boringe.

Brand-name authors are writers who'd sell
Even though they might stop writing well.
Brand-name products have names
That are trademarked. Court claims
For infringement are no bagatelle.

"Rub on elemi oil for complexion
Or steam it for chest-based infection."
Just a tad oversold?
Hype it right and it's gold.
There's no resin consumer protection.

The outsider art show had cippi—
Not the stelae from Rome—these were dippy.
The inscriptions were quippy,
Like "Bet your sweet bippy!"
Guess that one was carved by a hippie.

Some folks enjoy electronica—
Synthesized spew that is sonic, a
Disco-like beat
That they think is sweet.
But I'd rather hear a harmonica.

Modern game theory's how folks decide
And the reasons they may seek to hide:
Choices madly malicious
Or sane and judicious
May not be as they seem, cut and dried.

Most companies feel more robust
When part of a corporate trust
And when acting like brothers:
Resistance to others
Grows stronger. Some think it a must.

My friend Annie says anything goes
When a couple's in sexual throes.
She says I've no pizazz
And I hate all that jazz.
I'm just blah from my head to my toes.

That same rod that supports a guy's tent,
When employed with her tacit consent,
In an odd sort of sowing,
May start a life growing.
That's a gamogenetic event.

If you think that you might like to be a
Great thinker, your mind all set free, a
Good start: keep your pants on
And maybe you'll chance on
(Or fall on) a stunning idea.

When getting the heroine stripped,
Why's her bodice so typically ripped?
Better chance of romance,
Getting into her pants,
Would be getting her zipper unzipped.

An unpolished rube is a bumpkin.
An aft spar projection's a boomkin.
One hails us with "Y'all,"
One's found on a yawl:
Are homophones good for you, Pumpkin?

At midnight, I heard the bells knell;
From a crypt came a bloodcurdling yell
That filled me with fright
On that Halloween night—
By then I was running like hell!

Am I elegant, dextrous, or deft?
No; of grace I am sadly bereft.
As for why, you'll recall
That my feet aren't at all
Antitropic: they're both of them left.

Some say Dylan was greatest of all,
In the sixties, and loudest to call:
Through his songs, often mumbled,
Social barriers tumbled.
His verse helped unblock every hall.

Achondritic rocks, rockhounds find cool—
Well, they are cool; they've chilled in the pool
Of our meteor debris
Since four billion B.C.—
And their chondrules aren't there as a rule.

Cuts of beef you'll find butchers prepare:
Rump and sirloin (delicious when rare);
Shin and brisket (they're cheap);
But (unlike pigs or sheep)
Cows don't merit a chop — that's not fair!

The A. F. of L. - C. I. O.
Says a union's the right way to go.
But Wal-Mart is pissed
And its leaders insist
They're not needed. (But what would they know?)

No spin-doctor knows what I know, Sir;
At scheming I'd say I'm a pro, Sir.
Though I work for a price,
Here's some gratis advice—
Keep friends close but keep enemies closer.

Your financial plight getting too crummy?
Find it hard to get food for your tummy?
There's the food pantry, see?
They distribute for free
Meat and produce to make your meals yummy.

A collapsar's a gravity whisk;
On approaching, you run a great risk
That your atoms will flow
In a gamma-ray glow
And accrete in a spiraling disk.

Some nouns called collective are beauts,
But a few lead to minor disputes.
For example, this word's
To be used for the birds,
Not the geezers: a cover of coots.

Aenesidemus would quickly insist
That conclusions we need to resist,
As a question or doubt
Will most surely come out.
It's his main philosophical grist.

Glenn Beck's the hysterical host
Of a talk show on Fox—and the most
Hyperbolic of those
Blaming all of our woes
On the prez: "Hey, Obama, you're toast!"

I like truth, but I'm not a real vow-ist.
I believe, but I'm no holy-cow-ist.
With life's balance at stake,
I try hard not to take
Yin or yang to extremes… I'm a Daoist!

The Bullnose: an old British car
Made by Morris. It looked quite bizarre.
A round brassy rad
Like a bull's nose it had —
But a fine car to drive near or far.

Said the boss, "I should what!? Take you back?
Every project you drove left its track!
I'll depict how you were —
You were derelict, sir —
You were negligent, careless, and slack!"

With most chess pieces lost in the fray,
There remains the key endgame to play.
In this ultimate stage,
Both opponents engage
Further ploys that might win them the day.

I'm a farm boy from Boise and I
Favor raspberry hues, but I try
To sound French and urbane,
And not pastoral-plain,
By exclaiming "framboise!" — and that's why.

A blind craftsman, of whom I'm in awe,
Said, "I'll carpenter now a fine draw.
(That's a "drawer" to you);
Now just watch what I do."
Then picked up his hammer and saw.

When her wealthiest clients were lost,
Into debt Debbie's dress shop was tossed.
She will cut personnel,
And expenses as well,
But not rent, as her rent's a fixed cost.

It's the life of a spinster I'm facin'
By jilting the boyfriends who hasten
To ask me to marry.
It's William and Harry,
Those reign beaux, that I'm always chasin'.

"That gorger is stuffing his face
At a ravenous, gluttonous pace.
Boy, that beast loves to feast.
What a pig!"  "Hey, at least
He loves God.  Did you hear him say grace?"

A bracket, affixed with a screw,
Can hold up a shelf. Whoop-dee-doo!
[And, if you can abide
This sort of aside,
You'll see that it punctuates, too.]

Do you wish to aid someone who's ill
With a charm that will cure and not kill?
If you dig Santeria
The answer might be: a
Botanica might fill the bill.

When you undertake large works of art,
Working small's not the way if you're smart.
Don't start painting; don't etch;
Kick it off with a sketch.
Block in sizeable figures to start.

For a voter, the moment of truth
Occurs when he enters the booth
And must choose between those
Who are crooks that he knows
And the strangers who seem so uncouth.

Oh, mon cher chocolatier, please!
You are such an unbearable tease!
It is not comme il faut
To deny me gâteau
When for bon-bons I melt at the knees.

A plate of fried eggs over easy
Is addictive, so salty and greasy.
For a little more flair,
Cover up with Gruyère
And this time bomb comes out nice and cheesy.

xxX, xxX, xxA;
xxX, xxX, xxA
xxX xxB —
xxX. xxB,
xxX, xxX xxA!

Oddly, none of the albums he owns,
Not the Beatles, the Yardbirds, or Stones,
Really get him as much
As the whimsical touch
Of romance as conveyed by Spike Jones.

Down the walls of this canyon cascade
Many waterfalls into the glade.
Their paths have been etched,
Through the centuries sketched,
As the cliff's stony faces corrade.

Poor Henry—how strangely he grew—
Wears a huge, boxy, oddly shaped shoe:
Every side of the pair
Is a neat twelve-inch square.
And we try not to stare, yet we do.

So, in cross-ply the tire walls are stiffer;
The radial-ply clearly differ:
Their flexible ply
Is a sensible buy—
Good for roads with a hairpin or cliffer.

A mad cleric once dug a deep well
To prove Satan in Hades did dwell.
But the heat padre felt
Caused his shovel to melt;
The asthenosphere's hotter than hell.

The Butler Report well defines
How in Britain our press still declines,
For to label it "whitewash"
Is, being polite — tosh.
Today, few will read 'tween the lines.

Cladorhyncus, one genus of stilt,
Can be seen from the platform we've built,
Which juts out like a quay
Where the stream meets the bay.
There the waders stand, fishing, in silt.

Of archbishops we have only two,
Not too many but maybe too few,
All 'cause Henry VIII
Redesigned the old faith,
Which caused a terrific to-do!

Discontinuous lines — dash and dot.
Discontinuous thoughts — I forgot.
Discontinuous, then,
Is what you get when
Interruptions occur, as ... say what?

The candidate talked a good game.
Now he's prez, and his tenure is lame.
Seems his promises vowed
Were just words to the crowd.
He's all talk and no action — a shame.

Having finished my cup of Darjeeling
And set the old wireless to Wheeling,
I will look like a fool
As I stand on a stool
While attempting to mop down the ceiling.

If you're starting to feel you're "a-grooving"
And upward and onward you're moving,
If grumbles are few
And the praises ring true,
Then you know that your peers are approving.

"Dear Ramón: You are fat and possessive,
With intelligence far from impressive!
As a lover, you stink,
So we're through!" (Do you think
This Dear John letter's somewhat excessive?)

By derning himself in a cave
He hoped that his life he would save,
But he curled up and wept
As exploding shells crept
Near the hole that might soon be his grave.

Hid beside those troops standing inspection,
Our gunners escape their detection.
We'll chew them to bits
With an enfilade: blitz
Them with fire in a lengthwise direction.

I attempted to act nonchalant
On visits from Agnes, my aunt.
But her hair was so puffy,
I got a bit huffy,
And taunted, "Don't flaunt your bouffant!"

A singlet (one lens) is transparent,
But its focus is likely aberrant
When color's concerned.
As Newton once learned,
Achromatism isn't inherent.

Many freshwater catfish and dace
Get costiasis (having to face
Protozoans invading
Their skin and then fading
Away), but not saltwater plaice.

"He's not yet at the end of his tether,"
Said God of the Pharaoh. "But whether
He knows it or no,
He will soon let you go;
He shall thrust you out hence altogether."

It's our keep-in-our-home-and-our-truck tape —
Broken camp chair? We'll-just-reconstruct tape.
It's brought satisfaction
As emergency traction
For a newborn. Mirabile duct tape.

Ambrosia, the food of the gods!
But what do you think are the odds
That a coconut dish
With fruit, though delish,
Would immortalize average-Joe clods?

Our new scheme's a success: works effectively.
We let kids choose their courses electively.
Each selected a path
That had science and math,
And a language and arts class respectively.

A hen, of the cock on his lek syst-
ematically making her checks, hissed:
"Our roles here, I find,
Are by gender assigned.
The trouble with sex is it's sexist."

When he showed her what breaking a vow meant,
She decided to teach him what ow meant:
"What's endowed when you're born
Can be easily shorn."
When this happens, it's called disendowment.

"Fill 'er up!" I called out at the station
Where petrol pumps stand in formation.
It really was thrilling
To witness the filling—
But the bill gave no thrill or elation.

Across Africa, once, ran the dauw,
But you won't find it there any mauw,
As it's nearly extinct.
To the zebra it's linked—
Burchell's zebra we called it befauw.

I assassinate — that's my vocation.
My targets might lack some elation.
My complete fascination
With my aberration
Needs deep and profound contemplation.

Not the loo, nor the WC,
Not the john nor the khazi for me.
I don't mention the toilet,
Little boys' room would spoil it,
The bathroom's the place where I pee.

When one person's word is the law,
That's dictatorship. Do not ignore
Or contest the decrees
Addressed to you, please:
Say "Yes, dear," and not a word more.

Touch an object, the feelings you'll get
Will be epiperipheral, yet,
If they rise or begin
(As with hunger) within
They're an entoperipheral set.

It's abembryonic, this spot
(It's one where the embryo's not).
Whilst forming a baby,
We find that there may be
Some places unfit for a tot!

"This compound is ceric," I swore,
"Since its cerium's valence is four."
"If the valence is three,
Then it's cerous," said he.
(We were chemists, just checking the score.)

"My skin's getting crapy," I whine.
"You mean crepey," he said.  Okay, fine.
I look really crappy.
"One face-lift, and snappy:
I demand a new dermal design."

Though I'm not one to whine and complain,
Having sex with my husband's a strain.
Dyspareunia's what
Dr. Scott says I've got.
My vagina cramps up, causing pain.

Degravation's important in cases
Of dumping a corpse when the place is
A lake. Tie some rocks
Or some large cement blocks
To your foe—he won't leave any traces.

Hold on tight: your American Dream
May be dimming. At times it may seem
An impossible goal,
Wherein gold turns to coal—
But keep truckin'. Don't run out of steam!

We agreed to chip in to a pot.
"First to eagle will win the whole lot."
Well, a boon came to me:
A par five holed in three
With a chip in — a valuable shot.

Ever playing the strange arriviste,
The Avar wandered far from the East
'Til he found a good place in
The Danubian basin,
Where haply his numbers increased.

What's a grotto or cave? It's a grot
(Like the one in my garden), that's what!
I've said one of my mottoes
Is "Follies and Grottoes",
Though my trouble and strife thinks it's rot.

The Octomom started her brood
On a table, exposed, in the nude.
But she says not one kid
Will have kids like she did:
By a doctor — syringically screwed.

Lower Egypt's kings' symbol's the bee
(Egyptologists' "bj.t").
Nicely carved in the stone,
Or just painted, it's shown
Over names of the kings as a key.

I wish our affair hadn't started:
It has left me so hurt, brokenhearted.
Can't you see that I find
Your sharp words are unkind?
I am glad we have been far aparted.

It's a stainable substance that dwells
In nucleolar parts of our cells.
A transposal of basi-
parachromatin has a
Surprise: that's a lamprey it spells!

From the German, gesellschaft relies
On shared goals and impersonal ties.
In the interrelations
In organizations,
Formality foremost applies.

The word Aryan wasn't a sad word,
Meant a family (never a fad word)
Of tongues.  In its place
Hitler wrote "Master Race"
And turned Aryan into a bad word.

When it rains, my Drumbrella confounds.
Music's played on taut cloth.  This astounds.
As the passers-by gawk
At my Rain Drum, I walk
To the beat of the different drum sounds.

Greenwich Mean Astronomical Time:
A term awkward and less than sublime,
Which was used to display
Passing hours of the day
Noon to noon at Meridian Prime.

A priest, making sausage in haste,
Fell in, and was ground to a paste.
Though once a fine fella,
He's now mortadella,
And beckons to catholic taste.

I'm as green as a person can be.
No recycler is keener than me.
As I empty my plate,
I recycle a mate.
I'm a cannibal.  Do come for tea.

Let me cradle my son once again;
Let me hold him and rock him, and then
Take him home, if You must.
Unto dust I entrust
His remains, just a month short of ten.

An old fellow was bludgeoned, and dead.
A prime suspect was tracked where he fled.
He'd a hammer in hand,
But denied it was planned—
"It was mallet aforethought," they said.

There's a yelp. The dog's leaping about.
One more yelp! Wife screams, "Sit!" Kids both shout.
Flames and smoke. "Stand well clear!
The extinguisher's here!"
Spray the dog! Chaos reigns. I pass out!

My wife and myself — what's the trick?
Sixteen years now, we've run pretty thick.
It's sure not her butt
Or the size of my gut,
But whatever it is — man, we click!

Catupiry, Brazilians may boast,
Will taste great spread on crackers or toast.
If you are beguiled
By cheese milky and mild,
There's a chance you'll like this type the most.

"Count the votes!"  They were counted; Bush won.
"Well, then count 'em again!  We're not done
Till the victor is Gore."
The Supremes said, "No more."
Cries of "Stolen!" had only begun.

At the Weight Watchers Barbecue Bash,
Mrs Jarvis announced, "Pounds will crash!
What great pains I have taken
To thin-slice the bacon
And flavour the cucumber mash!"

Tell us, what in the hell's up the trellis?
"My Indian monkey: entellus.
This black-faced gray langur
Is quick to show anger.
Don't kiss on the terrace. (He's jealous.)"

Team Electrics lost always, and hence
To expect them to win made no sense.
Then by default they won;
And though shocked, I for fun
Plugged that team in June's Current Events.

I indulge in wild rages Vesuvian
When they call my work antediluvian.
OK, I build villas
With elegant pillars:
My buildings are classic Vitruvian.

Financialization today
Is economy-ruining, I say.
Making things to make dough
Is the right way to go:
Making money from money? Wrong way!

An adulterous ass name of Dunn
Was pursued by his spouse with a gun.
She took aim, dead on target,
Then fired, and—Aarrgghh!! It
Was done. No more fun—Dunn's undone.

In La Paz, leaders lie, but I hear
South Americans still hold them dear.
But, egad and forsooth,
When one tells the whole truth,
Not a soul will Bolivia here.

Celebrities, famous and rich,
Overnighting in London, will pitch
Up, direct from their flight,
At The Dorchester, right
Where it's at: five stars up from the ditch.

"Let us screw on the davenport, sport,"
She beguiled me, but then we were caught.
Her dad laid down the law
With the choices he saw:
"Wedding now, or your weenie cut short."

What's the fluid to use for correction?
Dripping water? A lethal injection?
Or the paper-white paint
That can cover the taint
Of an imbecile's inked imperfection?

Your website I'm trying to hack
By employing a dictionary attack.
What's your password? Don't know,
So instead I will go
Through an A to Z list front to back.

If you're keen on enlarging your pupil
Using plants that you choose without scruple,
Duboisine can be
Made from leaves of this tree.
Watch the size of your pupil quadruple!

A decimetre (tenth of a metre)
When cubed will define a full litre.
That said, it's okay
In the U. S. of A.
To insist that "four inches" looks neatre.

Folky "Mule Skinner Blues" was the seed.
Later, guys of a whole nother breed
Called The Fendermen totally
Changed it with yodely
Laughs and guitar licks on speed.

Through the store with her list he does browse.
Did his wife mean the milk that's from cows?
Was it rice? Was it oat?
Was it soy? Was it goat?
She will do her own shopping, he vows.

Said the general, "See, over there,
The form of that trench — crémaillère;
The zig-zagging line
Is a clever design
To bring a fierce cross-fire to bear."

I knew two Kentish blokes, dim-bulb divvies,
Who'd go hunting clad only in skivvies —
Not in Wellies or tweed
Breeks or waistcoats; indeed,
Should they come, they're the ones a host chivvies.

Some plants that are called beggar's-lice
Spread their fruit in a way that's not nice.
They're adherent, with prickles
That hurt like the dickles;
Avoid them (my expert advice).

My mate Zoran, Dubrovnik Dalmatian,
Is a Slav and an ethnic Croatian.
He doesn't like Serbs
And a Slovene perturbs,
For Croatia is 'top Balkan nation'.

Brooke's a crook—lost her way, gone astray.
Now she'd dead; she's a felo-de-se.
Life's so dreary (my theory)
She chose hara kiri.
Like her mom always said, "Crime don't pay!"

Subjecting a text to critique
Means pointing out which parts are weak—
Overall or one line—
And which parts are fine.
This punchline could do with a tweak.

The tension was eating me, truly,
Till my wife came and said to me, coolly,
"Don't stress out. Keep your head.
With the witnesses dead,
There's no reason to worry unduly."

A new bathroom is right up her street:
The long mirror that makes it complete
Shows a full-length reflection —
Whole-body perfection —
Including her trotter-like feet.

My name is an alias. Whether
I like being free of the tether
A real name can be
Is what I mean to see,
For I'm somebody else altogether.

Mr. Smith's a bit crackers; here's why:
"Flat Earth" is a concept he'll buy.
He clings to the notion
That, somewhere, the ocean
Has edges. He'll sail off and die.

Acuminulate: sharp by design,
At its tip not as blunt as a tine
Of the fork on your table,
But honed so you're able
To do work microscopically fine.

Where have all the aromas now gone
From cut flowers? We've seen a new dawn
Of these huge GM blooms
That now brighten our rooms,
With sweet fragrance a sacrificed pawn.

With the Beatles, you know what you get:
An LP that's an excellent bet.
"All My Loving" and "Money"
Are fabulous, honey:
The top of the poppermost, yet.

Thomas thinks he is sharp and efficient,
But in overblown speech he's proficient.
He'll always concur,
"That's affirmative, sir!"
When a "yes" would be more than sufficient.

Desperate measures, when all else has failed,
Are the actions most likely entailed
In a last-ditch attempt,
From which no one's exempt,
To repel those by whom they're assailed.

Oh, the French fries will get to you quicker
Than all but the butts and the liquor.
The coronary bypass
Lets one chance to die pass,
And freshens the lease on your ticker.

Absentmindedly here I post verse,
Which is bad and then gets even worse.
I know I'm no poet,
And by now you all know it.
I'm thankful that lim'ricks are terse.

When magicians shout, "Abracadabra!"
Odd objects, like lit candelabra,
Disappear in a puff —
Damn! I don't have enough
Valid rhymes to end off with an "-abra"!

Deconsecrated churches, not holy,
Converted to purposes lowly,
Are charming and quaint,
But religious they ain't,
Nor employed by the god-fearing solely.

Doc's response to the scan, instantaneous:
"There's no break, just a bruised-up calcaneus.
Heels can heal very fast;
She won't need a huge cast
Made of plaster—that's needless, extraneous."

Should a booby, with nary a care,
Fare afar, unaware, on a dare?
She should nap on her nest,
Clutching eggs 'neath her breast,
Lest she's whapped by a booby-trapped snare.

Their cries are high kees, and not squawks.
They fly low to the ground, since the stalks
And the leaves hide their prey.
They are active by day.
This Circus is full of small hawks.

I'm writing a rhyming discursion,
The subject of which is immersion,
And so Bath takes a hand,
With its Crescent… the band
In the Pump Room… the gossips' diversion…

Have you antlers of bone, rich in phosphorous?
Horns of compacted hair, like rhinoceros?
Pointed prongs?  Or a rack?
Well, if all these you lack,
Then, my deer, you are akeratophorous!

Album versions get edited so
That the radio deejays can throw
On the singles.  They'll play
The long versions when they
Need relief—to the bathroom they go.

Late at night in the bearded clam dorm,
The mollusks  would talk up a storm.
"Let us dance!" each one begs,
"No more tendrils, real legs!"
Too bad cirriform wisps are the norm.

While we all have the right now to vent
And complain to our own heart's content,
Still you can't use your shout
To drown other folks out —
That's mob rule, and not lawful dissent.

Bhutan's a small nation that's set
In the east Himalayas.  To get
Into India, best
To head south, east, or west—
Going north, you'll wind up in Tibet.

A production line fashions small parts
Into toasters or boxes or tarts.
But eukaryotes can
Build themselves from a plan:
Which shows autopoietic street-smarts.

In Paris, for breakfast I take
Neither bread, nor Ryvita, nor cake.
But croissants (that means "waxing"),
And although they are taxing
My girth, I adore every flake.

Coup d'etat: change of leader. Inspired
By a devious person he'd hired.
There ain't no disputin'
Steve Bannon loves Putin.
Will he tell Donald Trump "You are fired!"?

Of anatomy facts a dispenser,
I never will edit or censor.
What extends or makes straight?
Why, that trait is innate
In the muscle we call an extensor.

I look back on the deal unbelievingly—
How my broker beguiled me deceivingly.
"These investments can't lose,'"
He cajoled, "Don't refuse!"
Now I'm singing the blues, sighing grievingly.

Disappointment was brushed to the side
When a cowpoke's request was denied:
"I'm not fit, say the brass,
To make Cowboy First Class?
Hell,  I'll show 'em some cowpokin' pride!"

She is pregnant and nearing the birth;
Soon she'll labor for all she is worth.
Will her childbed remain—
Despite all the pain—
Her most awesome adventure on Earth?

Joe's a drip, though he looks quite a dish.
You'd think him engaging. (I wish!)
He's a train-spotting geek,
Feeble-minded and weak,
And his handshake is like a wet fish.

Rocky IV, as a film, is not great —
Anti-Sovietism's something I hate.
It's the same as the rest;
When the villain looks best,
Rocky floors him, I think in round eight.

Fluid ounce:  It's one fifth of a gill.
Take twenty of them, and you will
Have a pint (says the Brit),
And I freely admit
So much whisky is really a thrill.

I can feel Jason's pain—I'm empathic.
His face, oddly shaped, is prognathic.
But he doesn't seem cowed
Standing out in a crowd
And he's proud to be called polymathic.

To fasten, to join, to connect,
To affix, to augment, to collect,
To adjoin, to append,
To annex, to extend,
To tack on, to attach: to adject.

The bow compass? A bit out of date:
For construction instruction, it's great.
Now most drafting, we find,
Is computer designed;
Thus describing the compass's fate.

Friday mornings, at nine, we convene
In the room near the copy machine.
Our boss and our staff
Meet to have a good laugh
Before starting our daily routine.

Our estate steward's field books record
Where all goods and equipment are stored,
Notes on cartage and mileage,
On breed stock and silage,
And on firewood piled by the cord.

In the movies, we've seen John Doucette
Play the toughest guy heroes have met.
Injun chief to mob boss,
He's a man you don't cross.
If you did, it's an act you'd regret.

Neath Beddgelert's great oak lies the grave
Of true Gelert, a wolfhound most brave,
Who wast slain by the sword
Of his own wretched lord,
Tho' from death his lord's babe he didst save.

Reading chorally? Reading as one?
When in first grade you may think it's fun
To read loud from a page
With some others your age,
And you'll know the words well when you're done.

Though our work may not earn us a dime,
On this site we're devoted to rhyme
And to meter. Hooray
For A-A-B-B-A!
We're all having a very good time.

Said Injustice (the goddess Adikia):
"I have cursed you with vile leukotrichia—
Spots of white hair and skin.
You've committed no sin,
But you're punished because I'm just sick o' yuh."

Many plants that grow close to the ground
Are decumbent. But let me expound:
Stems normally bend,
Trending up at the end.
Look around, good examples abound.

I feel fortified, strengthened, to know
There's a place where I always can go.
It's a really good feeling,
Uplifting and healing,
When your local is just a stone's throw.

Daubentonia: genus of lemur;
Face the color of coffee with creamer.
Though the aye-aye's not strong,
When he's swinging along,
He'll be singing a song—he's a screamer.

The parachute squadron's new aide
Thought backpacks would do, I'm afraid.
On his lapses he muses,
As angry J'accuses
Of "Culpable negligence!" fade.

Abecedaries tutor us well—
How to read, how to write, how to spell.
They're the primers in school
That our children find cool—
Or at least till the ring of the bell.

They're my cringelings — look, see how they cower;
They enhance my prestige and my power.
With such creeps at my feet
I impress those I meet
(It's a sham, though — they're paid by the hour).

Marco Polo went trekkin' and mappin'
Through the East and the West overlappin'.
With his Orient trade,
What he certainly made
Was an Occident waitin' to happen.

I am writing this anapest piece
On soprano Danielle (yes!) de Niese.
Who else holds a candle
To her singing of Handel,
Or her Mozart and Gluck expertise?

When we took little Jim to the zoo,
This occurred, and quite suddenly, too.
"Oh Jimmy, watch out,
There's a lion about!"
It leapt like a bolt from the blue.

In old movies you'll see them a lot,
But to buy one today? You cannot.
It's a crush hat and that
Is the kind that lies flat
Until *POP!* it's a top hat you've got.

When I spied him soaped up in my shower,
I timidly chose just to cower.
I knew I should caulk
To keep out this auk,
But stood frozen for over an hour.

Are you tossing and turning at night?
Our mattress can help with your plight,
On a box spring that's made
From a premium grade
Of wrought iron, to help you  sleep tight!

When we feared that Katrina might kill
Ole Fats Domino (hardly a thrill),
How we wept and we moaned!
How we welled up and groaned!
How we cried upon Blubbery Hill!

Mother's prudish, and nothing can change her;
She cautioned that sex was a danger.
All my boyfriends, she said,
Were a hazard in bed—
So I went and had sex with a stranger.

Men are tiresome. Their wives, unenthralled
By male ego and hair loss, when galled,
Have remarked they're like tires:
They belong, too, on pyres
When they're over-inflated and bald.

An encounter in combat — sword swings;
A coming together of things
Or people, a meeting
Where everyone's greeting
The folks like they're lordlings or kings.

Capetian refers to the France
That from Hugh Capet's time would advance,
More than three hundred years;
At that time, it appears,
Came the end of its royal romance.

Let me make, without any coercion,
This firm diagnostic assertion:
My boss is a guy
With intense CRI,
Meaning "cranial-rectal insertion."

These puppies are all different breeds,
Many colors and sizes and speeds,
But they're all conspecific
(That term's scientific,
Implying cross-breeding succeeds).

A potato chip made out of beets??!
No, thank you.  I much prefer sweets.
For "Most Horrible Munchies,"
With Brussels sprout crunchies,
The beet chip most surely competes.

"Don't look at red wine," is the stark
Admonition of God, which I mark.
In the full light of day
I just drink chardonnay,
Leaving crimson shiraz till it's dark.

The acanthus, a prickly-leafed plant,
Is today for the most part extant
Engraved on the walls
Of Greek houses and halls.
If you like, you can touch it; I shan't.

At the base of each vertebrate's skull
(Be it lizard, or lion, or gull),
There's this hole through which flows
Nervous tissue, which goes
Down the spine. Geez! Anatomy's dull.

Alkoran, though an English word, can
Be derived from the words Al Quran,
Which is Arabic.  You
Use Koran—that's fine too—
If you need a two-syllable scan.

His sister ruled Thebes—Queen Jocasta,
But Creon was also a master.
When his sister had sex
With her son, Eddie Rex,
Creon soon made the best of disaster.

When into the wind you must hack
As it comes from your front, not your back,
Board and board is the way
To make progress this day:
Tightly tack, tightly tack, tightly tack.

Adolescent Antonio's roots
Were in football, not film. (Still, he shoots!)
Almodóvar brought fame
To Banderas's name.
He wed Mel, starred as Zorro, played Boots.

There's a serum-filled sac in my shoulder
That bothers me now that I'm older.
Despite three physicians,
This bursal condition's
Got worse since the weather's been colder.

The ship, decked with crossbones and skull,
Struck a storm; called the mate: "Lie ahull!"
Soon its mainsails were furled,
But instead, no wind swirled:
'Round the helm, lashed alee, was a lull.

With a child, you just can't be abusive.
Make your praise for him steady, effusive.
The love that he feels
When with family he deals
Must be total, sincere, all-conclusive.

Leonardo Da Felpi's great work
Moaning Lisa made all Florence smirk.
'Neath a smile so serene
Grew a beard of bright green—
It's no wonder the Pope went berserk!

A gullible tourist named Rita
Was eating a sandwich on pita.
The waiter said "Ma'am,
You're enjoying the lamb?"
But he knew it was really Akita.

If you want your advice to be heeded,
Concretistic examples are needed.
Don't just say, "Seize the day."
Add, "A roll in the hay
Won't compare when your hair has receded."

My new laptop refuses to boot,
So I'm thinking of filing a suit.
Plug and play this sure ain't.
If it started, I'd faint.
Lots of loot for this trash don't compute.

When I'm leading a rock-climbing trip,
I wear shoes that have plenty of grip.
I've a queasy conviction:
Without all that friction,
I'd suffer a life-ending slip.

The Bahamas, the Caymans, Belize
Measure temps using "F" in degrees.
That is Fahrenheit form
Which is also the norm
In US and Palau, boil to freeze.

Grace, a fitness enthusiast, feels
We've an over-dependence on wheels.
Though her mom in L.A.
Lives a good mile away,
She will walk it (though not in high heels).

Ptoley asked, "Mum, which viper is badder?
I know aspis is asp, berus adder."
"For a suicide, asp
Is the better to clasp,"
Cleo said. "Now you're making me sadder."

I could certify, sign and attest
That she's mad — yes, she'd go for a 'rest'.
But I also must state,
To be rid of one's mate,
That divorce, though it costs more, is best.

Being dolichocephalous, Gene
Had a very long, narrow-shaped bean.
Such cylindrical form
For one's head ain't the norm;
Still, to nickname him "Stovepipe" was mean.

A dandy-brush, used without force
By Lucinda, when grooming her horse,
Is a valuable bit
Of this stable girl's kit,
And will make him look good on the course.

I was teaching vocab to some teens.
The moon's phases? They didn't know beans.
"A half-moon's what you view
In-between full and new.
'Just one buttock' is not what that means!"

She embodied my every desire,
Her flip-flops her only attire—
Barely shielding her feet
From the sand's summer heat.
I stayed cool but my loins were on fire.

Heavy drugs, then a Swedish massage
That turned into a kinky ménage
À trois, quatre or cinq?
All the rest is a blank.
I came to during gastric lavage.

With mist drifting over the bay,
The moonlight to sunshine gives way.
The birdsong will rise,
As I open my eyes
To my favourite time: break of day.

The monoxide of barium's name
Is baryta; the sulphate's the same.
There are various heavy
Concoctions (a bevy
Of compounds) this name can proclaim.

When the drawbridge is up, there's no way
To the mainland by car, so we stay
On our island retreat,
Or, defying defeat,
We go boating and sail cross the bay.

Gerardus created a flap
With projections increasing the gap
Between latitude lines.
Cartographical minds
Took Mercator for naming this map.

My MP wants to iron out the flaws
That arise in creating new laws.
If he thinks they need pressing,
He has my full blessing:
I'll speak out and champion his cause.

The new intern's techniques are appalling.
Something dreadful may soon be befalling
Our clinic's wellbeing.
The staff's all agreeing:
His appointment's in need of forestalling.

This limerick is slightly defectious.
The pansy's the state flower of Texas.
Pigs can fly (and they know it).
I am a fine poet.
The defects — well, by my count there are about six, yes?

Gothic arch? That's an arch which is pointed,
With an apex that's typically jointed.
Such arches have seen
The odd king (even queen)
Being crowned and, before that, anointed.

On various points, miscellaneous
(Some pertinent, others extraneous),
We twelve were accordant.
His humor, quite mordant,
Enforced a rapport consentaneous.

Don't you piss on my turf; it's a niche
That my people have carved. You'll unleash
A firm offer that you
Can't refuse. If you do:
Concrete shoes made to measure—capiche?

Slow election results are the fount
Of conspiracy. Feel tensions mount.
Each political side
Will find ways to deride
What they'll label as lies. Let's recount!

We're the live-music hub of the world,
Where the Lone Star is proudly unfurled.
We're a hot high-tech place
With a wild breakneck pace—
To futurity Austin is hurled.

I did not get the email you sent,
And I have no idea where it went —
 An unpleasant surprise.
 In the aether it lies,
Which is space of unending extent.

"At a breathtaking moment on stage,
A white tiger escaped from his cage.
As the audience froze,
The magician arose..."
And I trembled while turning the page.

Calypso, a nymph from the sea
Holds Odysseus captive till he
Goes and gives her the slip—so
He sings—a calypso?
(The style that his song ought to be.)

A comb may be strawberry, pea,
Rose, buttercup, cushion, or V-
shaped, or silkis or single.
If chicken flocks mingle,
Genetics say which it will be.

I think short-order cooks are just smashin'
With their hairnets and grease-spattered fashion:
Cafeteria-style!
Every once in a while
I will woo one (I ration my passion).

Stars' spectra show shadows in series;
Hence Balmer directed his queries
To the spacing of lines
Caused when hydrogen shines,
Which led Doctor Bohr to his theories.

It's a bike box, just white lines on black
On the tarmac, to keep the cars back
Fifteen feet. It's a place
Marked as bicyclists' space.
When the light changes green, back on track.

Tell me, where am I going, and how?
For what happenings should I allow?
As I hustle and hurry,
I constantly worry,
"Just what will become of me now?"

I despeeded — impulsively sent —
Out an e-mail.  Oh boy, did I vent!
That won't happen again.
I'll calm down, count to ten.
When the boss read my gripes, out I went.

A concerto's a musical rhyme.
The soloists wait for their time:
It's the orchestra's duty
To take turns, sharing beauty—
Back and forth, through three movements sublime.

With kudos, the critics express
Their opinions  of Thomas Adès*.
The Tempest wins praise
As an opera that pays—
It's attained an amazing success.

The security fence of our nation
Lies in bioattack preparation.
If we have a staph meeting,
Will our men take a beating
Or defend against bacterization?

Hydrocarbons begin their formation
During sediment lithification.
After thousands of years,
Coal or oil then appears.
Diagenesis names this mutation.

If you're wanting to sculpt or to paint
An anthemion, not seeming quaint,
Use the proper technique.
Make it floral and chic,
Because if it isn't, it ain't.

Carbon spreads out its arms into space
Where it holds four more atoms in grace—
From methane you can
Get four chlorides—the plan:
Let the chlorines the H's replace.

Bidirectionally, I shall go,
Heading forth, south and north, for I know
Wonders beckon, my love,
In those soft hills above,
And lie deep in the valley below.

"It's theah on the boadah," said Alice,
As she gave me directions to "Callous"(?),
"You won't get theah today
If you call it Calais,
'Cause Down-Eastahs, we rhyme it with malice."

From snowstorms we're shifting our focus.
Rainy April's beginning to soak us.
Our garden's the locus
Of spring hocus-pocus:
The magical surge of the crocus.

Now, in Morse Code, a dot's pronounced "dit,"
While a dash is a "dah." Think a bit:
Dah-dah-dit. Dash-dash-dot.
Do you hear it, or not?
Sounds like gibberish, here, where I sit!

When you travel by sea, life's complex.
For the privacy needed for sex,
Your small cabin suffices.
A word that is nice is:
Companionway (stairs between decks).

There's a bridge that is named for the strait
'Twixt Marin and SF—it's first rate!
Though it's not painted gold,
It's a sight to behold.
And that strait? It's the great Golden Gate.

I react to Juan Flórez. He sings.
His high C can affect living things!
This man's bioactive.
He's more than attractive;
His act is, in fact, made for kings.

Set me free, let me be, DPP.
You're Director of Public, I see,
Prosecutions: do choose
Whom to try and accuse —
But the public? That can't include me!

To each word I give maximum weight
In the limericks I strain to create.
I don't shirk—I'm no shirker—
Since I work, I'm a worker.
Deverbative nouns are just great!

Three old folks fast asleep in a row,
Doing nothing, with nowhere to go.
Since their number is three,
We've a hat trick, you see.
Geriatric I'd say! Ho ho ho.

Now the dirt dikes are crumbling; the walls,
Too, are tumbling; there's blame because all's
Going to hell in a basket.
Fiddle-dee and a-tasket!
Kinda late for our waking-up calls.

Barracuda: their bites make a mark,
And they're scary to meet in the dark.
With teeth so impressive,
These fish are aggressive,
But not in a class with the shark.

Yes, I bring home the bacon to Stan,
'Cause I like to buy things for my man.
True, he's mean, so it's odd,
He treats me like a god!
(Though I'm poorer than when we began...)

I've heard that in Germany there's a
New cheese that's quite creamy, yet shares a
Formaggio thrust
With its white fromage crust —
Cambozola: a composite Käse.

An auxiliary verb, I would say,
Is a word that could help every day.
If you will, it's a term
That might mean that you're firm:
When you do have a will, there's a way.

To select lots of stuff in one shot,
A cool shortcut will grab the whole lot.
Data placed in your hands
Will await your commands.
I would say Control-A hits the spot.

Said Hemingway, planning a prank
On O'Connor, "I just want to thank
And congratulate you
For your candid review.
You were earnest, so I will be frank."

Business expenses seem great
As you gleefully pile up your plate.
If they're claimed to the max,
You may pay much less tax
And potentially gain much more weight.

At the stop, two young lovers embrace.
They lock lips, wrestle tongues and suck face.
They can keep all that fuss,
Cuz all I need's a buss—
God, the service out here's a disgrace.

Kiss those babies!  And suck in your gut!
Always smile for the cameras!  Do what
Fifty experts all say!
(Wooing voters this way
Is a massive campaign in the butt.)

The Bible's commandments are ten,
A prescription laid down for all men*;
But this newspaper bloke
Thinks it's all a big joke —
He needs four, just: Who? What? Where? and When?

There once was a fellow named Lloyd
Whose adenoids really annoyed.
It caused him to snore,
And his wife to abhor
The evenings she once had enjoyed.

Does becoming a butterfly hurt?
Does the chrysalis hope to avert
Its emergence to light?
Is it scared to take flight?
My anxieties keep me inert.

When I'm weaving straw baskets, I yearn
To achieve just the right sort of turn,
So I sweat and I toil
When I'm making a coil
Like the circinal frond of a fern.

Though I started my studies excitedly,
I was lost and I stumbled benightedly.
I was baffled, nonplussed,
Then expelled. How unjust!
My devotion was met unrequitedly.

Since we can't start our campfire with that wood
(It's too damp),  I'll go get us some fatwood.
It's a resinous pine
That will light up just fine.
What I'm doing's what any smart cat would.

See these shadows we're casting tonight?
Turn and look at the source. What a sight!
The moon's more than half full
(Seems it's flaunting its pull),
And its gibbousness grants enough light.

The Arava Desert's a sliver
Of land where you won't ever shiver —
From the Sea that is Dead
To the shores of the Red,
A stark beauty that leaves me aquiver.

I've gulped Advils and such by the score,
But my purulent jaw still is sore.
I'll dispense with a sleuth
And deduce "abscessed tooth."
I need antibiotics — hard core.

Tracy Caulkins, it's easy to see,
As a swimmer was all she could be.
What's exceedingly cool,
When she last left the pool,
Were the records she held: 63.

Did you know wine is sold in a box?
In a bag made of plastic that locks
Out the air that can harm—
Make the wine lose its charm.
Give me box wines the connoisseur mocks!

You are highly allergic to bees?
Had a stinging encounter with these?
Epinephrine just might
Be the drug that is right
To restore you to breathing with ease.

Garden hoes? Folks are always devising
New tools to cut weeds. Not surprising,
The Dutch hoe (you shove)
Is one gardeners love.
Slice away—but no grass-roots uprising.

Your exceptionable bill is offensive;
My objections abundant, extensive.
You are charging for wood
Twenty times what you should,
So my building's unduly expensive.

CH, if you're in the UK,
Means "Companion of Honour," they say.
It's bestowed by the Queen,
So its opposite's seen
As FWP (USA).

"You will never epistolize me—
Not your follower; never will be,"
Cried my colleague, once docile.
"Get another apostle!"
(I just wanted to write her, you see.)

Shipping registry Lloyd's had begun
To use classification "A1":
Highest quality, fine,
It's the top of the line
And a sauce for my steak that's well done.

Playing classical music we find
Smallish groups which may vary in kind;
Just a few, two or three,
Maybe more folks, we see
As a classical ensemble designed.

There's an old philosophical view
That holds Christian means humanist too,
And that freedom is part
Of the Christ-indwelt heart
Of all humans on earth — even you!

A dancer called Skinny Lenore
Wore bracelets and bangles galore.
Pirouettes death-defying
Sent anklets a-flying
And skittering out through the door.

The Brits might use bitty for small,
Describing an elf who's not tall,
Vermouth for martinis,
Or itsy bikinis.
(Don't call your man bitty at all!)

Your submission today is a joke.
I assume you've been snorting more coke.
As an essay, it's dross;
It's junk that I'll toss.
As we say in Old English, it's croke.

Wearing ribbons in shimmering bows,
She bedazzles wherever she goes,
They're her joy and her pride,
But they won't come untied,
So her sparkling collection just grows.

Call them parasols, bumbershoots, golly!
The English stay dry with a brolly.
In the U.S., a fella
Prefers an umbrella.
In windstorms, to use one is folly.

Far be it from me to belittle
Or indict this poor fern 'cause it's brittle,
Nor to have this plant trounced
'Cause its name's mispronounced.
It's unfair—I demand an acquittal.

An airhead inventor's creation
Of gas-pumps for room ventilation
Will pipe in O2,
And thus save quite a few
Careless smokers the cost of cremation.

The day of accounting draws near,
So be certain your ledger is clear.
You'll be once again whole
When you've scoured your soul:
Let your sins be disbosomed, my dear.

After hours of intense concentration,
I am still in extreme dubitation.
You have left me in doubt,
As I can't figure out
What your play is about. What frustration!

On the cruiseship, the overworked purser
Who, irked with an avid converser,
Charged a kiss on each cheek
For each minute she'd speak,
Filled a fine-setting role called amercer.

His father chastised him, in rage,
"Whelp! You left my gold watch as a gage
To a loan-shark, in pawn.
You're disowned. Get you gone."
(Inward groan: "He'll go on for an age.")

On an island nearby: "Time to mend
Years of ignorance — now they shall end,"
Declares Prospero, quite
To Miranda's delight.
"Listen closely, my girl, now: attend..."

When scratching his ass during Mass,
Father Flynn gets a pass for his brass.
But he's going too far
When he puffs a cigar
And slurps gin during Sunday school class.

I'm the best in the business, no slouch
When it comes to relaxing, I vouch.
So to say I'm all action
Is simply detraction —
I'll proudly spend days on my couch.

Those livestock may wish to rethink
Their plot to escape from the clink.
Breaking loose would require
Dodging all that barbed wire—
The wire that those long chains enlink.

What a job! I'm a slave! It's indentment!
Can you now understand my resentment?
As an intern, I thought,
I'd have fun. Now I'm caught.
All I feel is extreme discontentment.

In our grammar the accusitival
Now faces uncertain survival.
There's a shadow of doom
Stalking them, him, and whom —
I shall miss they when faced with deprival.

When the new Reformed Church was perfected,
And some Catholic believers objected,
They launched in each nation
The counter reformation.
Hail Mary! Their ways were protected.

Your antipathy still going strong?
You have hugged that ambition too long.
The dang milk is long spilt;
I ain't 'fessin' to guilt,
But we're sisters. This business is wrong.

This diet book sure is a fount
Of good tips on controlling the count
Of the calories we
Consume daily.  (I see
That my intake's too vast an amount.)

That banderol over our door
Bears our motto, "Go forth and explore."
It's carved fully unscrolled,
Yet that's all it can hold.
It was chiseled before the Great War.

"The judge viewed your case with derision,
So he rendered an adverse decision.
But when paying my bill,
Do not bear me ill will,
'Cause I saved you from going to prison."

The DA and the public defender
Do battle in court but surrender
To passion each night.
They don't argue or fight
When succumbing to love's magic splendor.

His vacation won't really perturb Les.
In the country, distractions disturb less;
But he parks on the lawn
Of his cottage each dawn,
As the road that he lives on is curbless.

My grandma reads Dashiell Hammett
And plays of the great David Mamet.
When the language is lewd,
She remarks, "My, how crude!
Are the censors all sleeping? God dammit!"

We were wed in a modest stone chapel
Neath blossoms of cherry and apple.
The bride's papa carried
A shotgun. We married.
(It's a weapon with which one can't grapple.)

Boston Brahmins are families  still
Living on or around Beacon Hill.
They're American peerage
Who didn't come steerage,
Can send, down the nose, looks that kill,

Don't use cash, but say,  "Send me a bill,"
Eat their pasta with lemon and dill,
Own a cattle ranch down in Brazil,
Put a Hahvahd bequest in their will;
Think  their own genealogies thrill—
Someone help me stop writing this swill!

Dancing monster, it mangles and maims:
Even metal, turned molten, it claims.
We'll remember this theft
When the embers are left,
With the rest all consumed by the flames.

Du Maurier, author of note,
Was intrigued by the past; was remote.
Now her work is renowned
For the plots that abound
'Round the Gothic romances she wrote.

The aim of the binge-drinking game
Is to burn with a low bluish flame.
With your first drink, you're lit,
But soon roar where you sit,
Till you end up a spluttering shame.

There's an acid called EDTA
That the medical scientists say
Can remove things like lead
From one's body. They said
It forms compounds one tinkles away.

Can your theory survive an attack?
Falsifiability: that's its huge lack.
We in science are blessed
With a clear-cut first test —
What we cannot prove false, we can't back.

God a code virus bloggig by doze,
Ad by 'puter's god dutz. I subboze
Dat a virus idfected

Wud virus is bad. Doo just blows.

I want farmland that's "green", more sustainable.
I was told it would help if it's drainable.
Said a farmer, "No doubt
If the water flows out
Of the soil, then your goal's more attainable."

Count Dracula's looked at with dread.
He's often described as "undead."
This archfiend's immortal.
He'll storm any portal.
Just ask anybody he's bled.

Dug from mud that till now was our bed,
Two-shelled mollusks are heartlessly fed
To the fans of our kind,
Who have food on their mind—
Bivalve goodies to add to their spread.

Is your shtick like a redneck's or hick's?
Do your jokes make folks snicker? Do chicks
Find your cracker-barrel humor
Falls flat? There's a rumor
You'll fail—even out in the sticks.

I got fast curbside service today
From the lot of the local café
Where I ordered my food,
And a carhopping dude
Soon came out to me.  (No, he's not gay.)

The science of EM induction
(As for motors in Hoovers for suction)
Michael Faraday founded
And Maxwell expounded
By means of Newtonian fluxion.

With CD on your car (not a bike),
You're no person who's likely to strike.
Corps Diplomatique
Is the crowd or the clique
Of ambassadors and/or the like.

As a child, I could feel no affinity
With the Christian season of Trinity.
The church calendar led me
To find the wait deadly —
From Whitsun to Advent: infinity!

From a long LBW shout,
A lone finger goes up and I'm out.
But a chance to review
Means that ball tracking's due,
And it's missing! Yes! Never in doubt.

There's a word for what moulders away
And has rot, putrefaction, decay.
Decomposer's that word.
And it's plainly absurd
To think Mozart or Wagner, today.

Those bagnios are brothels, it seems,
And for business they go to extremes.
With music two vied
To lure takers inside;
"Dueling Bagnios" were filling men's dreams!

We elected a principled fellow
To Congress, who quickly turned yellow.
With his courage askew,
I'm ashamed by this true
Gutless wonder whose spine is like jello.

The president spoke with alarm
About cuts that, he said, would cause harm
So severe, but when that
Didn't work, he then sat
With his rivals and turned on the charm.

As the crust of the earth waxes old
It will wrinkle. A push makes it fold
And a pull tears a fault —
Not a random assault,
But diastrophism's force taking hold.

When it's dawn and my lawn's wet with dew,
I feel sad. I owe debts that are due,
And I'm broke—got no dough.
I sing: fa,  mi,  re,  do;
Notes go low when I'm blue—yes they do!

A groper is not what you'd wish
As a person — but fine as a fish.
It's found in warm seas
And its flavour will please;
Pan-fried it's a wonderful dish.

With a Golden Delicious to eat,
There's no need for the doctor to greet
Me. No matter the day,
I will keep her away,
As my one-a-day target I'll meet.

To stimulate germ execution,
The Pope promised full absolution
To those who had showered
And constantly scoured:
Though sinful, they'd mastered ablution.

A limerick is, by design,
A poem that's written five-line;
Counting feet, I have seen
There are always thirteen.
Anapestic ones? That would be fine!

Kitty purrs at the head of my bed;
At the foot snorts my terrier, Fred.
To my right snores a whore,
To my left snores one more—
And the old ball and chain's in the shed.

Called a death growl (or simply a growl),
It's a vocal style used with a scowl
Where it mostly belongs,
Which is death metal songs,
Sometimes mixed with a scream or a yowl.

It's no bed of roses, my life.
I encounter much trouble and strife.
When I see your position
And wealth acquisition,
My jealousy cuts like a knife.

It's a mix (mostly meat) in a skin;
An old car; or a firework's din.
A banger can be
Any one of those three,
Or a madam enjoying her sin.

We see the whole world in large masses
And divide them all up in three classes—
Those that we're rotten to,
Those that we cotton to,
And the rest—just a bunch of dumb asses.

An expiator says, as a start,
"I acknowledge my sins." If he's smart,
He will then make amends
Since he knows that that sends
A firm message: he's changed mind and heart.

You bum!  On this floor I shall fling
(Throw with vigor) this fake diamond ring!
I shall show you the door;
You'll betray me no more,
Neither you nor your pitiful "thing"!

Of a fellow named Mel I will tell.
He was mellow and sang very well—
In his choir—like a jewel.
When challenged to duel,
He was yellow, and Mel ran like hell.

Your swing is abysmally slow,
Which the pitcher and catcher both know.
Every time at the plate
You receive the same fate:
Three fastballs, three strikes—down you go.

Darryl's done Carol wrong.  So, clean Carol
Gets his gun.  She is careful the barrel
Is wiped free of grime,
And then, in her own time,
Carol flips, through the heart, dirty Darryl.

C's a most indispensable note.
In the middle, it anchors by rote.
But if it's in your pocket,
You surely won't knock it—
You'll be pleased that it's snug in your coat.

On a floor made of sawdust, compressed,
Or ceramic, or pine that's distressed,
Whether plush wall-to-wall
Or a rug in the hall,
A carpet makes each look well-dressed.

Here's some rock-layers, laid in a lake,
With a diastem (temporal break).
Depositional lapse?
Or erosion, perhaps?
Are we sure there has been no mistake?

Abolitionists versus partitionists
Serves only the States' oppositionists.
To avoid such a fight
Let both parties unite
For the Union, as grand coalitionists.

Take care, guys, the girls are out lookin'.
Bikini-clad bait will soon hook in
The sexiest hunks
Sporting tight swimming trunks.
You've been warned: all the barbies are cookin'.

There's frustration, or maybe elation,
As you near your desired destination
On a plane or a ship,
But the end of your trip
Is most certain to be disembarkation.

When he told me, I felt quite suspicious.
He'd declared that his clothes were cilicious.
I misheard, cried, "Salacious?
What next? Goodness gracious!"
But they're woven of hair, and not vicious.

Take courteous foreign relations
And pair them with like aspirations;
Add sharing the best
Of all jokes east to west,
And we'll strengthen our comity of nations!

Though municipal means are quite meagre,
For advice our electees are eager.
To this end, large amounts'll
Be spent by the council
On fact-finding trips to Antigua.

Back down on the goose farm some clown,
With this pitch, would make grandfather frown:
"Back down! Make a killing
With plastic foam filling."
Not Gramps! He would always back down.

When the royals pass, keep them unseen.
Just avert your rude gaze from the queen!
You are common and coarse,
And you'll feel much remorse
If you dare by your stare to demean.

Why is it that limericks flow
If the topic's decidedly low?
It takes little to coax
Scatological jokes;
Nasty anapests seem apropos.

Alarm is the fear that will fill you
When you think that a mugger might kill you.
Or else, if you're rich,
It's a system for which
Some security guys overbill you.

Aladdin was surely depraved.
I was plucked from my lamp and enslaved.
The despotic young thug
Sought to fly on a rug.
You'd think he'd be better behaved.

The deliriant drugs are narcotic
And result in behavior chaotic;
You will bypass neurotic
And enter robotic,
Psychotic, quixotic, despotic…

You want background?  I'll give you BG,
But it has to be on the QT.
I'm a clone of Deep Throat —
See my coat? Here's a quote:
"If you squeal, I'll deny it was me."

There's a pupa inside that cocoon.
It's not exiting anytime soon.
No, it's not due to sloth;
It's the way of a moth
(E.g., luna—a word that means "moon").

These loaves contain something called DATEM.
Its long chemical name makes me hate 'em.
It makes the bread chewy
And springy, but phooey!
Very low on the scale do I rate 'em.

Intriguing to contemplate, this is:
The small Discocephali fishes
Live by suckers attached
To their hosts, on them latched,
And must therefore comply with their wishes.

I thought I'd break in and purloin
An arcade game. A kick to the groin
Was the screen. What it had
Was a burn-in so bad
I could only see this:
INSERT COIN

Ad astra per aspera, they say,
Is the brave, meritorious way
To ascend to the moon
When there's no silver spoon
To make child's play out of the fray.

Alfalfa sprouts taste just like grass,
Yet vegan folks think they're first-class.
A nice little crunch
To add to your lunch —
A healthy, spaghetti-like mass.

The artist Vecellio (Titian)
Painted dames of a fat disposition:
These ladies were wealthy
And thought it was healthy
To gorge on Renaissance nutrition.

Some folks draw a line in the sand.
How brave! How heroic! How grand!
If it looks like a bluff,
One line's not enough,
And soon they'll have no place to stand.

The cheeks of the anthropoid bottom
Saved humankind face when we got 'em.
The odd parts they conceal
Would, perhaps, make us feel
Quite embarrassed should ever we spot 'em.

What with lipstick and rouge, and such stuff,
My sweet honey looks comely enough;
But with smudges and wear,
She dabs makeup repair
From her compact, with powder and puff.

The carabineros all train
As Chile's police, but in Spain
And Manila this title
Refers to those vital
For guarding the coastal terrain.

When it's B-K-L-Y-N, U C,
That means "Brooklyn," most folks would agree.
What's this BS about?
Why not spell the thing out?
All the letters you're saving?  Just three!

Twixt ocean and swale's warm embrace
Stand the sandhills, the dunes, sculptured grace.
Facing winds and the tide
(And some storms on the side)—
Tufts of beach grass hold dunes in their place.

If I keep up the hunt for this game bird
(In the wild—the Crypturi's no tame bird),
And I aim with my rifle,
But jerk it a trifle,
I'll catch me a living-but-lame bird.

I am tired of being harassed, Lee.
Your attempts to seduce me are ghastly.
In my faith I'm secure
From your motives impure;
To my Christian beliefs I'm tied fastly.

Our coincident autos collided
When their time and their place coincided.
If you'd waited a while,
We'd have missed by a mile;
And my choice not to stop was misguided.

If good drainage you wish to attain
To protect your ground floor from the rain,
Dig a ditch, throw in stones,
Cover up, make no bones
About what you have made: a French drain.

Fred Thompson withdrew from the race
For the White House; he didn't keep pace
Raising cash to contend,
Thus he couldn't ascend
Much beyond his conservative base.

His experimentation's controlled,
But alchemically clever and bold.
Taking tungsten and lead,
He's been forging ahead
Turning commonplace metals to gold.

I've a limerick on discous, and thus
Let's examine, talk over, discuss:
Would we ever confuse
That old word we don't use
With discuss? Not a chance! Why the fuss?

Its symptoms include somnolescence,
Aggression, and foul-mouthed excrescence—
It's nothing malign;
Your kid'll be fine,
If you can survive adolescence.

When a girl has a smile she can show,
She's a Brownie—young Guide with that glow.
Does she do a good turn?
Is she eager to learn?
Are those badges she wants you to sew?

In the chemical processing biz,
An active ingredient is
What the stuff you make has
That supplies the pizzazz.
It takes filler and gives it its fizz.

At the lake, I'm too nervous to swim out
When the power dips low (there's a dim-out).
"What? You're scared of the dark?"
Barked my ex-boyfriend Mark.
That's what sparked my desire to throw him out.

"I'm a bona fide genius", he'll boast,
"And my brilliance is known coast to coast.
 I'm a Mensan, indeed,
 I will always succeed —
 If one judges by who brags the most."

If you'd rather we didn't all hear your throat,
I suggest that you cough and so clear your throat.
Could it be a frog's stuck
In your gorge? — such bad luck!
For amphibians shouldn't go near your throat.

Come patter with raindrops asplatter,
A drizzle or drenching or spatter —
Come sunshine or rain,
I'll be chanting again,
But I'm casting a charm for the latter.

War unthinkable? Sadly, it's here.
Sarajevo's the flashpoint; that's clear.
The foul deed has decreed
All of Europe will bleed.
After this comes the deluge, I fear.

The Ctenocephalides flea
Is a pest; dogs and cats would agree.
In the absence of pets,
This parasite gets
To attacking, when starved, you and me.

Dirty Dan glued a car from a friend.
One day later his crime spree would end
When the law, Sheriff Fred,
Glued his ass and then said,
"In the hoosegow you're gonna be penned."

Fossil fuels give us energy—nice!—
But burning them comes with a price:
The gas they release
Makes the Earth's heat increase.
That's why Greenland may lose all its ice.

This is simply a fact, not polemic—
To describe a disease as endemic
Means you might find a case,
Any time, any place.
In the body, you'd call that systemic.

While flipping a hamburger patty,
Poor Mitzi went quietly batty —
Said, "French fries with that?"
As she deep-fried a rat.
"There's no difference; it all ends up fatty."

Vote to earmark our tax—then some bucks
Will be spent on what pleases those clucks
Who drafted the bill,
For good or for ill.
For me, it's a system that sucks.

This new heat sensor I will equip
With a well welded steel-copper strip.
Warmed or cooled it will bend
Up or down, and will send
Out the signals for switches to flip.

All the evidence shown has been damning.
The defense team had better start cramming.
All the witnesses swear
About who, what and where.
Soon the jury may set jail doors slamming.

An airplane's a useful machine.
Its flight in the sky is serene;
It soars on its wings,
Carries people and things,
So high it can scarcely be seen!

Of all of the comic strip cops,
Most agree that Dick Tracy is tops.
As in real life, he shows
That in locking up foes,
Innovation (high tech) never stops.

Yes, the bill of the pelican relican
Hold more than his pelican belican.
People still see how welican
But not how the helican
Stock more than a pelican delican.

The premise on which he was basing
His theory of timing and spacing?
Though bound to befuddle,
His "great cosmic cuddle"
Was deemed, it would seem, all-embracing.

There's no way you can win in this duel.
While his words were offensive and cruel,
He's a masterful shot—
That is something you're not—
And you're crosseyed, you ignorant fool!

It's confirmed; we've just tallied the get:
This year's fair's the most lucrative yet.
While the "food police" fumed,
All the eats were consumed.
(Chuchi's chili's still making me sweat.)

When my editor gets too uptight
Over format, I'm not one to fight.
But I'll always give voice
To my personal choice
Anent style — my authorial right.

The Big Apple and Beantown are places
The average native embraces.
They are home, in large part,
To both commerce and art
And, come winter, to frostbitten faces.

My congressman acts like a leech,
Seeking gifts for his favors from each
Of the voters requesting
His help. I'm not jesting.
It's time, I would say, to depeach.

Rowlings read my report with a frown.
"It's too simplified—much too dumbed down.
Dumb it up with quotations.
You'll win commendations.
Quote Shakespeare, Descartes, Jerry Brown!"

I'm a commonplace, average Joe,
And I ask what "just folks" want to know.
Blow your top, walk away—
Won't affect what I say.
Major outlets still carry my show.

It comes after 'a', before 'c',
And is always a comfort to me.
Times of trouble and pain —
Mother Mary's insane!
Words of wisdom for all: "Letter b."

In my dream, I recalled with chagrin
What a great concertmaster I'd been,
'Til the orchestra voted
To have me demoted
To cowbell from first violin.

The cider last autumn was sweet,
And the way that we made it was neat:
We took apples uphill
To the old cider mill.
They were squeezed in a press. What a treat!

What celebrity started a flap
Getting caught with some babe on his lap?
There's the national debt,
War, and famine, and yet
We concern ourselves daily with crap.

"I'm no charity case.  Get a grip.
I'm not constantly broke.  I won't skip
Out on treating our meal.
What's the bill say?  For real? "
"Never mind.  Spring AGAIN for the tip."

I'm a chef and it causes me grief
When breadcrumbs, against my belief,
Are in meatballs.  I find
That the beefier kind
Almost never make customers beef.

'Twas a freeze-out which hit me at school
When they said, "Let's ignore this young fool!
He's invisible, yes?"
Thus they caused me distress
By their treatment, dismissively cool.

To dewater's to make something dry—
To dehydrate, to end the supply
Of its moisture, deprive
Of what keeps plants alive—
No matter the how or the why.

The abelia's so pretty, I think
With her flowers of red, white, or pink.
	The frost doesn't please her
	(Don't put in the freezer!)
But she does have a most pleasin' stink.

I cannot stand digging, yet buy
Some digs with a garden, so why?
Well, I dig smoking weed,
And dig up all I need.
Do you dig where I get my supply?

You have asked if I like Dutchman's pipes.
I'll admit they are one of my gripes.
Many plants have this name
And they're not all the same.
I can cite at least three different types.

When your wallet's gone flat from the bleeding,
Chapter 7 provides useful reading.
But it might have been apter
To first read a chapter
On how to avoid the proceeding.

Let a foot-candle light up the park."
"You'd set fire to my foot with a spark?"
"No, I'm not, dear, inhuman!
It's the light of one lumen
Received per square foot. Park's too dark!"

The crabgrass is starting to creep
And the alfilaria is deep,
Causing terrible woe
To my garden, and so
I've decided to weed 'em and reap.

Whereas some people clean and eat creekfish,
I'd much rather feast on some Greek dish.
For I don't like to scrub
The detestable chub
Sucker. Nibbles? Well, I'll go with leekrish.

We're both bossy, my husband and I.
Domineering, some say with a sigh.
But though some might disparage
A two-bosses marriage,
Each day is the Fourth of July.

That song is melodious and sweet!
It's tuneful, it's chantant, it's neat!
It's wonderfully clever.
Forget it? No, never!
The beat moves my soul and my feet!

At the jeweler's, the guy asked (dim-witted),
"What size are you? Ever been fitted?"
Not seeing this bit meant
A bit of commitment,
He probably should be committed.

A double-take, that's what I did.
At first glance, half her face had been hid.
Fully seen, oh, how nice!
Yes, I had to look twice —
She'd grown up — was no longer a kid.

Anatomically speaking, you're bony.
You're jug-eared, you're also hormoney.
From your toes to your chin,
You're all covered in skin.
In summation, you're full of baloney.

The flap of a butterfly's wing
Causes chaos: that one little thing
Set the weather adrift,
Gave the markets a lift,
And made fractal bloke Mandelbrot king.

What the TSA officer lacked
Was a good sense of humor. In fact,
He replied, "Your allusion
And crotchal protrusion
Are two things you'd better retract!"

A toddler was caught unawares —
Best Practice for Play-Doh declares:
"The clay's kneaded soundly
And always shaped roundly,
Since cubically's strictly for squares."

Evasive, corrupt, and a liar,
That candidate swims in the mire
Of scandal.  Reject
Her deceit.  Don't elect
One who's crooked; our straits will be dire.

Fine young men from Great Britain were wrenched
From their homes, shipped to France, and entrenched.
In the dug-outs, each thud
Of the guns rained down mud
Mixed with shells, leaving uniforms drenched.

Marcus Phelps, archaeologist, dug
In the High Atlas mountains (the mug).
He found nothing but bugs,
Though he was offered drugs,
And paid over the odds for a rug.

Once on Superman, hunky George Reeves
(That was George's show, mind you, not Steve's)
Found a clue and said, "This
Is adenophyllous, Miss.
You can see it has glands on its leaves."

When, in FORTRAN, a coder writes "DO",
Then some lines for the code to loop through,
Execution repeats
Till an index completes.
(When it's stuck, your computer turns blue.)

Butcher Brown has a safety-first quirk.
He said to his helper named Kirk,
"Here's a little reminder.
You should face the meat grinder,
Or you may get behind in your work."

A cattleman isn't a cow/
human half-breed, with horns on his brow;
He's a person who tends 'em,
And now and then sends 'em
For slaughter, to turn into chow.

Though they're forecasting grapefruit-sized hail,
We'll go out to deliver the mail.
There's no weather, they say,
That will get in our way.
We will fall to our work without fail.

Our business went bankrupt today.
Junior creditors feel some dismay.
Those with higher authority
Get the priority
Absolute; they get their pay.

The dog on TV I just saw
With nettles stuck into his paw
Walked two thousand miles
To his family, all smiles!
But my friend just responded with "Aw."

Aides-de-camp must respond to the call
Of their more senior officers — all
Of their whims, each desire,
'Til the big-wigs retire,
Even personal trips to the mall.

With my children I'm not very strict.
Our values will seldom conflict,
But a drug of abuse
Is a no-no.  Its use
(Like amphetamine's) tends to addict.

In Norway, a beast has a claim
To some national animal fame.
Of all on this list,
It is one, I insist,
That is tied for the tiniest name.

My uncle's estate is definable;
My fairness is never malignable.
I distribute the checks
As the man's will directs
And assign what is clearly assignable.

Francois, newly wed, was in strife,
Though his wound would not cost him his life.
When the doctors acceded
Debridement was needed,
He thought he must give up his wife.

Whenever I feel melancholic
And I'm not in the mood for a frolic,
To chase away blues
It's hot cocoa I choose.
That's the view from a true chocoholic.

A bivvy bag (bivouac sack)
Takes the place of a tent in your pack
When you've mountains to climb,
But ain't wasting no time
Lugging canvas and poles on your back.

Of this forest, the biomass means
What will soon be removed by machines.
It's the sum of the wood
That we'll harvest and should
Be enough for a million latrines.

Dear Amplias: Greetings. It's Paul.
Bring your pals to our gang, it's a ball!
Our heaven is cleaner,
We let you have wiener,
And don't make you trim it at all.

Sorting fruit all day long: more than dull.
I select based on size, and I cull
All the blemished and bruised
Till I'm stressed and bemused.
"Keep or toss" sends me out of my skull.

Good mechanics aren't common, I fear.
Highly skilled, they are men to revere—
Women too, nowadays.
Their fine work earns high praise,
And beats buying new cars every year.

A fiber that's toxic to man;
A substance we're starting to ban;
A mineral mined.
And now I've defined
Asbestos as best as I can.

It's true that we humans are flightless;
In darkness we're very near sightless.
But whatever we're missing,
We've got lips for kissing
To make the long night less delightless.

My friend Pete likes to walk on concrete.
Frozen pizza is all he will eat.
All his clothes are synthetic—
His thinks it's prophetic.
Antinature, he feels he's elite.

State nicknames? Just one is the quota.
How strange that they seek to promote a
Wolf-like creature that's sly.
Can you please tell me why
The Coyote State means "South Dakota"?

Happitis, Happitis. Drillatis,
Readitis, Dreaditis, Stillatis!
Buildatis, Spikeatis,
Armatis, Strikeatis,
Abatis, Stabatis, Killatis!

To get to my villa in Spain,
 I hopped in my aerospace plane.
Though three hundred miles out
Is a long way, no doubt,
It's much faster than taking the train.

Round the Christmas menorah we're rockin',
And the Chanukah bush needs a flockin'.
And the atheist dons a
New robe just for Kwaanza.
Any credo or faith?  Come a-knockin'!

I avoid the marked paths when I'm hiking;
The backcountry's more to my liking.
With a few fellow purists
I shun all the tourists;
The scenery's splendid and striking.

I stare at that blank-canvas hue
And it seems to declare, "Entre nous,
Colour me? My complaint:
If you dare try to paint
Over me, I'll decolourize you!"

In a business, make others surrender
Through a buyout technique: creeping tender.
This offer is nice —
Buy the stock, market price,
And the company's yours, you big spender!

Deliberate defence—get this clear:
Of attacks from your side, I've no fear.
'Cause I'll cut all your wires
And I'll flatten your tyres,
So you won't have a chance to come near.

A benefits package, my friend,
Doesn't get you free docs without end.
But it helps when you're sick
(Gets you cheaper drugs quick)
So your savings don't take years to mend.

The brewer's old wife, Jill De-Vere,
Was a little too fond of "good cheer".
Full of whisky, she fell
In a vat; now she's well
Cask-conditioned (along with the beer).

Well, I'm deep in the doldrums for sure.
This listlessness lasts; there's no cure.
I'm despondent and blue.
I've no job, I've no you —
This life has no draw or allure.

You're ecaudate. The word makes you quail?
That just means you're without any tail.
Though in your case I'd guess,
Since you lack all finesse,
It just might mean with women you fail.

If your Fido's "Fidelio's Song
Ima Teapot," now don't get me wrong,
But pound puppies, for me,
Beat the whole AKC
(That's American Kennel Club) throng.

On his back, Chicken Little began,
With his feet in the air, his brave plan.
Friends said, "Hold up the sky?
You're just one little guy!"
He replied, "Well, one does what one can."

My good reputation got hurt
By the gossip you happened to blurt.
I'm unfairly now tagged
As a fraud.  I got dragged
Through the mud.  You were dishing false dirt.

As we struggled, his fist hit my wrist—
Might have broken my nose, but he missed.
I'm delighted to fight
If I must, but we might
Cease our combat—in peace coexist.

Caveman Dana's inventions brought raves.
His latest was caves within caves;
He invented the closet
And now can deposit
Big bucks in the bank where he saves.

Once a pocketbook (held in the coat)
Or a basket or purse folks would tote,
There was plenty of room in all
Forms of the crumenal,
A handbag for times more remote.

It's a small yellow flower that begs
Her to pick it, but Peggy reneges.
"You are merely a weed,
And you'll never succeed.
You're just toadflax, or butter-and-eggs."

As we struggle, our deadline draws near.
It's become ineluctably clear:
Though alive and, yes, kicking,
Our clock is still ticking—
Hope a last-minute grant will appear.

I once had a little pet auk:
Black as night(hawk) and whiter than chalk.
On the sidewalks he'd balk,
Fly, and squawk (kids would gawk),
But off Norwalk, he swam the moon's walk.

Seen with Ed, a gamine, just fourteen?
That's 'n image, I 'magine, obscene.
Is my mea(n)ing unclear?
Soldier, join in game here!
What's that thing Elgar wrote, GI, mean?

Me and Paul are a couple of chumps
Who are lugging large loads of life's lumps.
We haul garbage and trash
For some small chunks of cash.
This job's got us way down in the dumps.

Wild mustard (its flower is yellow)
Can be found in a cornfield, dear fellow.
Sinapis arvensis
In Latin — one senses
As charlock it's sounding more mellow.

Sprawling Texas was once a dry state.
Now it's not, and for most folks that's great.
But Throckmorton's dry,
So for me, when I cry
In my beer, it's the beer I create.

Said the colonel, "Our last dress parade
Showed us not at our best, I'm afraid.
Seems most marched minus shoes
While in cutoff dress blues,
And displayed many frayed bits of braid."

When a cheese boutique made its debut,
To its counter I hungrily flew.
"I've got eyes for your cheese.
Could I have some Swiss, please?"
"Ha, that's droll. It's got eyes for you, too!"

Transformation to queen from a trollop
Can be measured in terms of a dollop.
The chances are slim,
And the outcome is dim.
The idea is naught but codswallop.

Some performers can dislocate knees
And shoulders and elbows and squeeze
All their joints even more so,
Contorting the torso,
For pure entertainment (and fees).

"I'm assiduous, therefore I'm tart,"
On an off day said Rene Descartes.
He'd intended to say,
"I'm acidulous." Hey,
Great philosophers aren't always smart.

The coach took a look in my locker
And yelled, "Oh, my God, what a shocker!
You've got drugs—it's a bust!"
I said, "Chill, coach, it's just
For my calcium channels a blocker."

Due to space, let me make this succinct:
This cute dog to a novel is linked.
Though the breed is quite old,
There are few now, I'm told,
And they soon may go wholly extinct.

"There's been dodgery blacker than soot!
This is something up with I'll not put!"
Howled the banker, whose vault
Had been breached (not his fault)
When nefarious deeds were afoot.

Elmer Fudd saw his prey, went to grab it,
Then said, "Hey, I don't think yaw a wabbit.
Though yaw awfuwwy funny
Dwessed up wike a bunny,
Yaw in the wawng stowy, dagnabbit!"

Films with knights?  I'm an avid consumer!
But I've heard a remarkable rumor:
Is it true those at Camelot
Ate ham, jam, and spam a lot?
(Of course not.  That's Pythonesque humor.)

While enjoying a bowlful of cereal,
I erupted a sneeze so bacterial
That I opened my eyes
To a foaming surprise:
It fermented my breakfast material!

When a pilot has trouble with attitude,
His craft won't allow him much latitude.
But once pitch, yaw and roll
Are back under control,
We applaud him with deeply felt gratitude.

To Roland and Coco I spoke
Of a tree in the yard of some bloke,
How its height would impress,
"It's an ash tree?" (Their guess.)
"No it isn't, Ro, Coco. Burr oak!"

Yes, it's sausage I serve a lot here,
Like my bratwurst and bangers with beer.
But I really get stoked
Eating beef-and-pork smoked,
So my cervelat's specially dear.

Yes, the car that I'm driving's a heap.
I'm a steadfast economist, creep!
Though that word is old-fashioned,
Its meaning's impassioned:
I'm thrifty! I'm frugal! (I'm cheap.)

Cafeteria Catholics may say
That premarital sex is OK.
The devout they disdain,
But Church leaders maintain
One's religion is not a buffet.

In a snowstorm, the airlines deice
All their planes that take off—sometimes twice.
Seems that ice on the wing
Is a dangerous thing;
If an airplane goes down, that's not nice.
 
So they use an effective device
That, in competent hands, will suffice
To make sure the planes go
Safe and sound in the snow.
Though it's pricey, deicing's precise.

Meet ELIZABETH: upper-case, fat.
E's an upper-class, bold as brass prat.
Scale her down by degrees:
Lower A, B and Es.
Meet eLIZabeTH:  hello, e (flat).

They're ubiquitous holes that we fill
With our garbage, dejecta, and swill.
We're creating these cesspits
Without any respites.
Our sewage is making us ill.

"How was Dean Martin killed? Drowned in beer!"
"Donald Trump starts a movie career!"
"Elvis had an affair
With both Sonny and Cher!" —
That's celebrity gossip, my dear!

He was late as I stood by the gate.
Should I just walk away? Should I wait?
Which one should I choose?
Will I win? Will I lose?
Will my path through life bifurcate fate?

The king and his consort were wed.
In the castle that evening, she said,
"Dear, this place is dilapidated.
It's time you decapitated
Your chamberlain!"—planning ahead.

Is it longFunctionNames that you seek?
Then our programmingStyle's not unique.
Using camelCase means
Each developer gleans
The intention of some other geek.

"What's my calling?" I thought, in my youth.
I imagined a dentist or sleuth.
Though it's both that I'd bandy,
Detecting's now dandy;
It seems I can't handle the tooth.

Definition has this definition:
Explanation of words — that's its mission —
Stating meanings, like scrubbing
Means "cleaning by rubbing".
For more definition I'm fishin'!

A coffee shop offers so much:
Cups of tea, hand-baked cookies and such.
For some their employment
Involves joint enjoyment —
If you're stony, it's best to go Dutch.

What I miss is your honest regret
For a barb you alone can forget.
Your aim, whether true,
Or completely askew,
Leaves a wrong that is festering yet.

On our staff I'm the proud EiC,
But I'm also a WE.
Double duty I pull,
So my plate remains full.
For two jobs, I earn double the fee.

There's no fighting your true allegations.
We swindle, like most corporations;
Our first inclination's
To yield to temptations,
And cheat on our tax calculations.

A racing stripe streaks down each side
As he speeds to his hole, where he'll hide
And empty his pouches
Of seeds while he crouches.
The chipmunk then scurries outside.

A compilator's just a compiler;
Of records he may be a filer.
He may collect books
Or receipts from great cooks,
But he loves what he does; he's a smiler.

My old man is a dustman; he picks
Up your rubbish.  He found in the mix
Some stilettos, a blouse,
Skirt, and wig at one house.
Now he looks like those street-corner chicks.

When a team needs a score, first of all,
A dropkick would not be the call,
As that play's now unsound
Since the ball isn't round,
In my country's  great game of the fall.

The large gemsbok, an oryx gazelle,
Has bold markings, embellished as well.
Its straight horns are a fright:
As long skewers, they might
Spit one just like impalers from hell.

Actinometry? My explanation:
The measurement of radiation
(The "incident" sort)
Photochemically caught,
In electro-magnetic migration.

The accused said, "Your honor, I'm faint,
And I don't understand the complaint."
He was handed his fate
When the judge said, "You're late
With your taxes; I order distraint."

His interest, he said, was artistic,
But in fact it turned out fetishistic.
What's it like to discover
Of my feet he's a lover?
Well, I howled and I wailed—went ballistic.

Cost accounting's a way to keep track
Of the outlays in ventures you back.
Systematic recording
Of spending's rewarding:
I've gone from the red to the black!

Your corroborative statements support,
And in no way contest or distort,
What I told the D.A.:
I was home on that day.
Don't you cave, if you're challenged in court!

In phonetics, dentality's what
Sounds possess that explode from the spot
Where our tongues, at their tips,
Touch our teeth, while our lips
Stay apart—as in "thither" and "thought."

For a duodecillion you've beckoned?
That means ten to the seventy-second
If in long scale you count;
It's a smaller amount
When in short scale big numbers are reckoned.

He tells lighting he sees a reflection
Backstage, from the scenic projection.
His actors can't act
But he fancies as fact
He's on track for awards in direction.

Sometimes weather reports make me blue:
"A depression is soon coming through!"
I just turn off the news
And then head for my booze.
I'll let other folks worry and stew.

The Dinka, a tribe of Sudan,
Is a very intelligent clan.
Their folklore is oral,
Their credo is moral;
They preach, "Do the best that you can."

He says, "Fair enough. Let it be."
And that's close enough to agree.
Though it isn't ecstatic,
Or even emphatic,
"Fair enough" sounds like music to me.

The white-flowered wall-rocket grows
As an annual. I can disclose
That its mustard-like taste
Is why sometimes it's placed
In green salads (for bite, I suppose).

Sammy Hagar just barrels along
Down the highway—but something is wrong.
Seems his cruise control's stuck—
Fifty-five! What a schmuck!
Now he's singing a different song.

With my gold lamé suit, this pink brooch
Is above and beyond all reproach.
You can't criticise me;
I've a style guru, see?
(You should criticize him — he's my coach.)

I must get a new apparatus
To silence my old doggie flatus.
For the smell there's no quibbling—
I'll just blame a sibling—
But stealth would insure my top status.

His attire was truly absurd.
But his wife? She said nary a word.
She just packed up a box
With his pants, shirts, and socks.
Now the Emperor's new clothes are preferred.

Said in Cymric, the greeting sounds nice:
As they smile, they say "twll tyn pob Sais",
Sing Cwm Rhondda — and that
Very loud, very flat.
Just avoid them, and don't go there twice.

I'm an aphis — I eat all your crops.
I devour your green carrot tops,
And the fruit from your trees
I will happily seize.
You don't like it?  Well, just call the cops.

Let us congregate — all join together,
But this barn isn't safe from the weather.
If tornadoes should come,
We will scatter, like chum,
And then disgregate — run hell-for-leather.

Now arterial spurting... Oh, Nick!
"Get the medic, with clamps, this man's sick!"
Got that haemostat clipped,
So the blood vessel's nipped.
Nick's still sick, but the doctor was quick.

The young architect's scheme was imaginous:
A design that was strictly favaginous.
"Your honeycomb plan
Is no home for a man!"
Raved the client, "Your plan's putrilaginous!"

The month of December costs dear.
We buy presents, rich food, wine and beer,
And enjoy Christmas Day
When our kin come to stay,
While the poor on their own shed a tear.

On OEDILF, I went nearly ballistic
(Behavior uncharacteristic)
When I saw anti-'til.
Made-up words are pure swill!
Call my stance anti-neologistic.

Beware! Cayenne peppers are hot,
And I really don't like them a lot!
It just wasn't nice
Putting them in my rice—
Now my nose wants to sniffle and snot!

Poor John Napier foundered in fog;
Condensed vapor had covered the bog.
He was groggy, unable
To work at his table;
Unstable, he tripped on a log.

Baby showers are trendy, you bet,
'Cause of all the neat stuff you can get.
Some hauls are astounding!
(Despite how it's sounding,
The little ones never get wet.)

When a company's ripe for the picking,
An e-trader's keyboard starts clicking.
While in hock, on the block,
It's appealing deal stock
While the takeover clock is still ticking.

Cyclopropane's reactive. Its ring
Wants to snap like an overstretched spring.
Carbon bonds are at ease
At a hundred* degrees,
So just sixty's no comfortable thing.

He's a caesarist, runs his regime
Like a tyrant, and this is his scheme:
To have absolute power,
Each day, every hour.
To conquer the world is his dream.

If you're craving a snack with some zing,
Grab a zesty, fried Buffalo wing.
Lay the bleu cheese on thick;
Add a celery stick.
It's a munchie that's fit for a king.

I'm a skydiver, putting my fate
And my faith in my gear, but they're late —
Both reserve chute and main
Jammed and stuck — what a pain!
This is grave — yes, the gravity's great.

Those new girls in Accounts will do fine.
The task of assessment is mine,
And (let's have no sniggers)
To check out their figures,
I've looked for the real bottom line.

That Benghazi crew's at it again:
Certain members, it seems, have a yen
To prove someone is lying.
Seems forever they're trying;
They'll keep at it till I don't know when.

With asphyxia, someone turns blue
From low oxygen, high CO2.
Choking, drowning, and gas
Can each bring it to pass.
I don't care for it. How about you?

Our son is a big Xbox gamer.
It drives his mom nuts; can you blame her?
All day he does nuttin'
But push some darn button;
I can't think of a single thing lamer.

I've a taste for the purely aesthetical.
With varied procedures cosmetical,
I've become better looking—
No reading, no cooking.
For him, my appeal?  Silhouettical!

Don't send candy.  Don't bother with flowers.
Don't talk sexy for hours and hours.
Ablutophilia means
I dig soapier scenes:
Baths excite me a lot as do showers.

We salute this important addition
To cars: automatic transmission.
It upgrades utility
And boosts drivability—
We love turning on the ignition.

Your decisions have left you perplexed
And confused, and a little bit vexed,
But don't quit.  Persevere.
There's a map.  You are here:
This decision tree shows you what's next.

It's chlorine that's found in our pools,
And in fountains for water at schools.
I just can't get enough
Of this germ-killing stuff,
'Cause for swimming or drinking it rules.

Put the cuffs away, officer. Wait!
There's no theft of my ex's estate.
Though I know this looks odd,
When we parted, by God,
I was told I'd been given the gate.

My grandma is called "Iron Gran",
Working out at her farm when she can.
Loading huge bags of corn
Till her shoulders are worn,
Lifting grain's her graniferous plan.

Avid birders will watch whippoorwills —
Even robins and terns give them thrills.
Their hot breath they must bate
While observing birds mate.
These are people enjoying cheep trills.

There are those who convincingly say
Amphioxidae showed us the way.
Those lancelets all lack bone,
Yet hinted at backbone—
And that's why you have one today.

The beard called the Dutch you'd install
On your face if you don't like beards small.
With no mustache, it's full
And quite macho (no bull!)
And well-rounded—not pointy at all.

It's more than a simple old fire —
A blaze snaps and crackles much higher.
It can be an emotion
That conjures that notion;
Example: "A blaze of desire".

"I won't go on the road any more.
I find planes and hotel rooms a bore,"
Said the shortstop. "I'll play games
At home—not away games."
The manager showed him the door.

If it's value you want for your money,
There's a cheese with a name somewhat funny:
Beehive Fresh you should try.
Moisture content is high.
You can take it from me, it's a honey!

Frank's a fanfaron; yes, he's a bragger.
Observe his gargantuan swagger.
With a cynical sneer,
He denies knowing fear,
Though when faced by real danger he'll stagger.

This carnage we wreak is insanity,
Which flows from our hubris and vanity.
We power our boats
Through a mammal that floats.
Oh, the crimes that we do to you, manatee!

"You tripped on some razor-sharp wire,
Then landed head-first in a fire.
Your calmness is baseless:
You're footless and faceless!"
"But groin-height—that would have been dire."

What's a daddock? A body that's dead—
Though it hasn't been murdered or bled.
You ask, what could it be?
It's an old rotten tree
With a center that's mushy like bread.

Bathysiderodromophobia's a dread
Of subways that fills up my head
With irrational fear,
So I do not go near—
I ride Scarface, my tiger, instead.

Talking smooth, looking trim, nipped and tucked,
Fielding questions (the tough ones he's ducked),
Till one evening, when he
Right on prime-time TV
Drops the F-bomb. Man, auto-destruct!

It's a rhythm whose third beat is stressed;
For limericks it beats all the rest;
As it trips off the tongue
Like a bell that is rung—
What it is you will surely have guessed!

Hickory dickory dockery,
Mice are well known for ad hockery.
They're all impulse and will,
So their forethought is nil:
Any plan's sure to bring murine mockery.

When he spoke off the cuff, people laughed
At his blunders—they thought he was daft.
Did he really believe
He could read from his sleeve?
But ad-libbing's an art, not a craft.

What is making your longhorns feel sick?
It's a nasty brown bug: cattle tick.
He'll leave you a griever—
Bring convulsions and fever.
You'd better get rid of him quick!

An entity may be abstract,
Transcendental, ideal — and that's fact.
It's a concept subsistent,
Although not existent,
For only in thought does it act …

We can't feasibly do it? I knew it!
Your words were, "That job? Nothing to it!"
We are now on the hook
For what we undertook —
An impossible task! Man, we blew it.

His affection's aflame; his great ardor
Is increasingly making it harder
To quench his amour.
He's becoming a boor—
Let's go find us some ardor retarder.

In a castle lived young Mistress Glover
And spouse.  He was shocked to discover
A man in his place
With a smile on his face;
In their bed lay the chatelaine's lover.

When the man sitting next to her shot
A huge booger on top of her tot:
"That's disgusting!" she cried.
"Pardon me!" he replied,
"Thought my hanky was handy; it's not."

After surgery done on your brain,
Some dysfunction will sometimes remain—
Perhaps dyssynergia,
Like disabling dysergia.
Unsteady, you'll walk with a cane.

The Catacombs, deep in the ground,
Is where ancient remains may be found,
And for Christians in Rome
They were prayers' early home,
Until Constantine turned things around.

Is there truth to the myth of Priscilla
And John Alden?  No, not one scintilla!
It was Longfellow's curse:
Mis-historical verse—
Like Revere's midnight ride on Godzilla.

Those dandelions dotting my lawn
Do brighten and lighten each dawn.
Their name's based on their leaf.
Though their blooms may be brief,
Many wish they'd decide to be gone!

Bertram Phelps (who prefers simple 'Bert')
Wears a coat hanger inside his shirt —
Silly man! — and because it
Should stay in the closet,
He finds that his clothes always hurt.

"Atishoo!" he gushed, with each sneeze,
Spreading germs and infectious disease.
"Only one?" we yelled back—
"Take the whole bloomin' pack,
But just cover your mouth, if you please!"

A cold front drives cool, drier air
Beneath moist, warmer air that was there;
Storms that form are the norm
As they swarm and transform,
Bringing rain, hail, and snow, so beware.

There was a young monk from Bhutan
Whose robe was in need of a darn.
He spun thread off the back
Of a passing old yak.
Now there's an improbable yarn.

This oil of the almond is bitter,
And a poison for human or critter,
But Amarine still
Is the name of a pill.
One would think they could find something fitter.

If your vision's becoming quite blurred,
It is likely your case should be heard
By a doctor of eyes.
He may tell you it's wise
To act now. Don't let help be deferred!

A diamond is where you may view
A great game that I never outgrew
Filled with Little League jocks;
So while girls like their rocks,
Diamonds can be a boy's best friend, too.

Lost your bearings on odd, quaky ground?
Added words may clear up the profound,
May resolve or rephrase,
Blowing off mental haze.
Epexegetic enhancements abound.

The drugs you prescribed didn't work!
When I took them, my mind went berserk.
So were these even real? Could
It be, Doctor Feelgood,
Some little-known medical quirk?

I've forgone every breakfast, lunch, dinner.
Now five-nine, eighty pounds, I'm a winner!
Emaciation's the price
I have paid to look nice.
(Could I simply have swallowed paint thinner?)

Europeans call Europe their base,
But their forebears engaged in a race
To displace many others.
Colonial brothers
At times brought the label disgrace.

Forget feta, halloumi, ricotta!
Our own sheep milk cheese is much hotter.
If you visit our valley
In Poland's Podhale,
Try bundz, then mulled wine and sheep's trotter!

Son, your wife's taking life on the chin,
So step up, help her do for her kin.
They'll need basics and care,
So be patient… be there.
And forbearance is where you begin.

'Go-go dancer's derived from the French
Term à gogo'— 'So what?'—'She's a wrench,
Dances rhythmical scenes.
Does erotic routines.
Dresses scantily.'—'Wrench?'—'I meant wench!'

Anthrophobic, I'm fearful of folks—
Human animals (women and blokes).
People fill me with dread
'Cause they mess with my head
And they make me the butt of their jokes.

Baby splits are tough leaves you might get
When your first shot's a high or light hit,
But the pins that are left
Can be cleared if you're deft
And between them the ball can be fit.

In today's generation, you're punk'd;
But a Scotsman, of old, was begunked
If a trickster deceived him,
Befooled him and peeved him.
Today, though, begunked is defunct.

Bridey Prior aspired to acquire
Her attire at low cost—that means fire
Sale prices. She paid
Bottom rates in the trade,
And, unswayable, never bid higher.

Young Christopher, strollin' with Doyle,
Found an asbolin hole in the soil.
This wood-sooty oil
Set their tempers aboil:
Its removal demanded much toil.

What's the name of the tanker that banked
On a reef where it grounded and tanked?
The ship, if you please,
Was the Exxon Valdez.
'Mongst the worst US spills ever ranked.

Here's the jack pine; its interesting story
Is based on the cone's bradychory.
It lies dormant for years
Until fire comes and sears:
The scales open, and seeds sprout to glory.

So your favorite alcohol brew
Is layered (say, B-52)?
If you're trained in barology,
You'll need no apology,
For the science of weight you construe.

Her fantasy never was idle,
And her thoughts sometimes turned homicidal,
As her boyfriend would balk
When of weddings she'd talk.
When she spoke of a bridal, he'd bridle.

A byname is something you take
When your parents have made a mistake,
Like the dancer named Gay
Who informed us today
That his nom de ballet will be Jake.

A notorious tyrant was Idi
Amin. You can only ask, "Did he
Treat Uganda so well
When he made it a hell?
Was he psycho, deluded, or giddy?"

When the topiarist snipped at that tree,
You can tell what he meant it to be.
But those humps are absurd.
It's excrescent, that third;
Even Bactrians never have three.

A promiscuous sprinter named Wright
Could have fled from the soldiers all night,
But they barracked her speed
(And her, too), for you need
To be chaste to be chased into flight.

I'm tilling my garden of verse
To remove a contraction deemed worse
Than its forerunners till
And until. Let me kill
The apostrophized 'til—it's a curse!

You would never mistake them for cubes—
Epididymides: efferent tubes
That transport your sperms,
And can feel like coiled worms,
In your scrotum—down there near your pubes.

Said Newton, "My fluxions, you see,
(Speaking infinitesimally),
Use dots and not dees,
And that, if you please,
Differentiates Leibnitz from me."

All the reds and the greens I reverse;
Due to gender my problem is worse.
When I'm at the paint shop,
Don't know blue from ker-plop;
It is acritochromacy's curse.

Elimination is ruling stuff out,
Like opponents, or foods that cause gout.
Through a process thus named,
Apprehensions are tamed
By clinicians, expungers of doubt.

It's a mix-'em-up-quickly-don't-dally pot;
My fix-'er-up-sickly-Aunt-Sally pot.
It's a bowl (terracotta,
That's glazed by the potter),
The pharmacist's trusty old gallipot.

If your outlaws are hard to arrest,
Get this masked man to stay as your guest.
Mangy varmints he routs,
"Hi-yo Silver!" he shouts,
Then abequitates into the west.

Endamagement (injury, harm)
Took place by mishap on our farm:
The incompetent factor
Fell off of his tractor
And broke seven ribs and an arm.

Though a Benedict Arnold says he
Is no traitor, the facts disagree.
(If the man you'd appraise,
Go and look in the A's.
For the noun, it's right here under B.)

When skinning a neighborhood cat
(There is more than one method for that),
After bating the hide,
Tan it, stretching it wide,
So the leather will lie nice and flat.

A far-reaching  goal of guard Stan
Was to lengthen his arms' smallish span.
Every day in the gym
He would pull on each limb—
Dislocations dismantled Stan's plan.

I spend most of my birthdays abroad,
So that Time I can somehow defraud.
Far from home, years don't mount,
So a birthday won't count...
I suspect that this logic is flawed.

Failed a physics test; felt like a clown,
Then a classmate took note of my frown.
When he asked, "Why so sad?"
I replied to the lad,
"It's 'cause gravity's bringing me down."

Zara's frightfully nice, don'tchyaknow!
And extremely well bred — lets it show!
So incredibly pleasant,
This lady's no peasant.
And moi? — I'm so proud as her beau.

There's a funeral parlor pursuing
New customers.  Here's what they're doing:
They consider bereavement
Some sort of achievement.
Their slogan: "We're tops in boo-hooing!"

I am bothered by dreams of my ex.
In my nightmares, he looks like T. rex.
First he shows me his teeth,
Then those parts down beneath;
Then he asks if I want to have sex.

The priest said I couldn't partake
Of the bread or the wine; my mistake
Was to kiss and not tell.
Now I'm going to hell—
I'll confess, for my sinful soul's sake.

Joe the boat-rocker always must show
His dislike for the world's status quo.
When you think you've perfected
Some job, it's rejected.
Whatever you ask, he'll say "no".

When in college, it feels like a club
As you frequent the common, the hub.
And at meal times you enter
This gathering centre
For grub. Sorry, chum, there's no pub.

Our bodies are pressed close together;
Heavy cloth and a thin coat of leather
Keep us slightly apart
As our work day we start
With commuting in cold, wintry weather.

A DP is the sort who might say,
"From my home I've been driven away
As a war escapee."
Then again, it might be
When two guys are both out on one play.

Between eyebrows is nary a hair.
O'er the nose there the landscape is bare.
The glabella is slick
(It isn't a trick)
Unless you've a unibrow there.

I'm afraid Peter's heart's in VT,
Going fast, like it's gone on a spree.
Now the picture's complete;
There's a clear Dressler beat
On this sheet—look, it's Pete's ECG.

Mark three from the end and you meet
A syllable shy and discreet.
It hasn't much fame
But oh what a name!
It's the antepenultimate beat.

Troops need ordnance to handle the brunt
Of pitched battle; the soldiers can't punt.
Field artillery moves
Any place it behooves
Them to bolster the boys at the front.

Chocolate chips are intended to go
Into cookies (the dieter's foe),
Or in muffins for brunch—
But some greedy chefs munch
Till there's none left to put in the dough.

Occurring completely by chance,
The banker's impulsive romance
He deemed adventitious.
At times, though, he wishes
That love would prevail, not finance.

I thought smoking was nasty and crude,
But I still tried it out, and got screwed—
'Cause my thoughts rearranged
As my chemistry changed;
Cigarettes now taste better than food.

For this town you may not give a fig,
But for me life began in fair Brigg.
Have you heard of Brigg Fair?
Delius wrote this fine air.
(Edward Lear — the wag! — rhymed it with wig.)

Brush an ember, your hand jerks away,
'Cause an efferent nerve's saved the day—
You'll need fewer repairs.
The swift message it bears
Leaves no choice, and your muscles obey.

I bet Mickey's pup, Pluto, sees stars
When the snakeweed this poor canine mars.
While this plant hounds the earth,
It has minimal worth.
Dog's mercury's worse than cigars.

"I'm a biblical Beast of mean tricks
With a deadline that no one can nix.
I wish nobody well
As I rise up from Hell:
For some kicks, I'm en route (666)."

Carbonation in drinks that you swallow
Gives you bloating — that gas feels muy malo.
If I give you this Pepsi a
Case of dyspepsia
You'll see — oh! too soon it will follow.

Were there only one film you could see,
And you asked an opinion of me,
I'd say: "Without doubt
Peter Sellers stands out:
Dr. Strangelove is my nominee."

I stole Cash but had no place to hide.
I grew Haggard, felt guilty inside.
Serving time was my fate;
Now released, I've gone Strait.
I ain't Rich but I'll still sing with Pride.

This recipe's great beyond doubt:
It calls for a package of crout,
Some caraway seed
And a spoon of dill weed —
Then serve it with fried rainbow trout.

My dad as a youth was apprenticed
To a sculptor—a fine cinquecentist,
So he sculpted a while
In a Renaissance style,
But he quit. Now he works as a dentist.

Whenever some others agree
With what I said—or simply with me—
My feeling is strong
That I must have been wrong.
That's the way Oscar Wilde used to be!

In my chemistry class, I've grown fond
Of my partner, a pretty young blonde.
Just as atoms like sharing
Electrons when pairing,
We two have a covalent bond.

Johnny said, "I should be CEO!
The big boss, making mountains of dough.
It's the job with the powers,
But with very long hours..."
...Back to sleep in the mailroom he'll go.

All his billions, at death, total eight;
Made his money by dealing in hate.
All the stuff that he owns,
Which includes rivals' bones,
Forms his (more ways than one) gross estate.

The cyanide process is for
The extraction of gold from an ore
Whereby gold is dissolved,
But the cleanup's involved
(Which unscrupulous miners ignore).

"Citrus fruits are God's gift, you'll agree.
Perfect source of your citrus? The tree!
Get your Vitamin C
From fresh produce," says she.
"And you'll live to be ninety, like me."

I'm the site of Herr Jones's vendetta.
By Iskenderun, now I'm known better.
Biggest town in Hatay—
Come on down and stop by!
I'm the city called Alexandretta.

On our first anniversary, she fled
After stating we shouldn't have wed.
I protested, "My dear,
Have we wasted a year?!"
"Better later than never," she said.

You're a damn broken record.  You say
The same thing all the time.  Every day
All I hear: "Let's have sex...
Let's have sex...Let's have sex..."
If it makes you shut up, then okay.

Some anchors hold buildings together.
With tie rods, they counter rough weather.
They're the clamps that stem swellings
In the walls of some dwellings.
Walls can bulge; anchors work like a tether.

A siskin called aberdevine
May be found near the Rhône or the Rhine:
A finch, yellow-green,
Not pronounced with a "veen",
But rhymed with a beer mug — a stein.

"Hmm . . . an apple? I guess it's nutritious."
So he ate, but it soon proved pernicious.
After God threw them out,
Adam still thought her clout
Owed to Eve's being so babelicious.

With a husband at last by her side,
She was happy as ever, and cried.
Why the wedding day tears?
She had always—for years—
Been a bridesmaid, but never the bride.

Though they both thought their marriage endorsable,
Nuptial vows were, it seems, unenforceable.
They took lovers; they fought
And agreed about naught
Except this: each was highly divorceable.

You'd usurp, sir, what good men have earned?
Let all forfeited lands be returned.
Your deceit, sir, was boundless;
Their surrender, thus, groundless.
Henceforth, scoundrels like you shall be spurned.

After cotton or corn burst its seed,
Farmers' cotton patch geese grubbed each weed.
A dozen ate mo'
Than a farmer could hoe.
Now herbicide's killing the breed.

Bhopal is in Madhya Pradesh;
It's a city where memories are fresh
Of the havoc once wreaked
When some holding tanks leaked
And the culprits all prayed to Ganesh.

The buckskins they wore in the West
Were the breeches that went with the vest
On frontiersman like Boone,
Who killed deer and raccoon,
Ate the meat, and made clothes from the rest.

My Ferrari is simply bodacious.
Neighbours think it a tad ostentatious,
But who cares what they feel?
From behind such a wheel,
Looking down on them's most efficacious.

In the morning, the lady named Bright
Would regret being faster than light:
Though she's barely awake,
She can see her mistake—
He's asleep in the bed on her right.

Bread and circuses helped to forestall
Discontent, but what led to the fall
Of the Empire at last
(Roman, vaunted, and vast)
Was a loss of the penchant to brawl.

If you're thinking your house is a bore,
And owning it feels like a chore,
Transfer title to me
(I'm the alienee),
And then you'll be the alienor.

Though in fear that his stated intent
Might be blocked by some hostile event,
He refused to show fright,
Took no notice despite
His concerns—oh, how bravely he went.

It has singular uses, does eyeglass.
It's the eyepiece in kit like a spy glass;
A specs lens; a monocle;
The eyecup I'll chronicle
As a "bathe-eyes-if-damaged-or-dry glass".

Wrote the lawyer who filed a demurral,
Objecting to any deferral,
"This is clearly abuse
Of Bullwinkle Moose,
My client. [Signed] Rocket J. Squirrel."

"Chain reactions can sometimes be calm,"
The student replied with aplomb.
"Control is the factor
That makes a reactor;
You'd otherwise call it a bomb."

A rose is a rose was a rose.
Something comes, takes the stage, something goes —
Great events long forgotten,
Ideas gone rotten.
The dustheap of history grows.

This audit's as broad as we've faced,
But in one sense we find it a waste.
Though they look, touch, and smell
(Even listen as well),
There's just no accounting for taste.

"Well, we'll see how your knee bends at last —
How its flexion compares to the past."
"Doctor, look! It won't move!
Will it ever improve?"
"Please keep still till I cut off your cast."

At the farm, on vacation in Brewster,
In the barn, an old tomcat seduced her.
I recall very well;
It was clear as a bell.
That's the night that she crowed like a rooster.

You used to look handsome and splendid;
I was ugly, deformed and distended.
But time took its toll —
You've turned into a troll.
So it seems our dislikeness is ended.

To ensure your planned strategy works
And pre-empt all those 'told you so' smirks,
It's much better rehearsed
With a dummy run first,
To sniff out operational quirks.

John Cage, the composer renowned
For his usage of ambient sound,
Performed one piece he wrote
Which had nary a note.
In his Silence was music profound!

A chapelet — what a machine! —
It dredges and keeps harbours clean.
Buckets fixed to a chain
Scoop up matter that's lain
On the seabed — it's big and it's mean!

A psychiatrist studied the case.
"The Mad Bomber will show us his face,"
Said consultant James Brussel.
Using brains and not muscle,
He helped police narrow the chase.

Two parts silicon. Oxygen six.
That makes silicate, which we can mix
With aluminum; throw
In potassium. So
We make amphigene (leucite) for kicks.

If you're harried or haunted by hair
Which you feel simply shouldn't be there,
Electrologists will
Use their follicle skill
To resolve this distasteful affair.

My problem is common, some say.
It's internal strabismus—okay?
My abducent nerve's shot
And my sight's gone to pot,
And that's why I'm now looking away.

These soldiers were fighting a war,
But it's clear that they'll battle no more.
The body bags full
Of our patriots pull
At our heartstrings and tear at our core.

If your mind is possessed, we'll attest
That an exorcist's cure is the best.
But if flu wracks your body,
What isn't too shoddy?
Hot buttered rum toddy, plus rest.

When the sun appears straight overhead
At our planet's equator, it's said
That the climate may form
A severe gale or storm.
Equinoctial defines when it's fed.

A winemaking monk, a young Dom,
One night shattered the old abbey's calm.
Pérignon failed to rein
CO2 in champagne,
And the cork blasted off like a bomb!

Oh, boy! I can't wait! Boy, oh, boy!
Like a kid with a shiny new toy,
I feel I could skip
Every step of my trip
To Disneyland. Wow! What a joy!

In a true dipyramidal case,
Pairs of pyramids join at their base.
At their points, you would find
Any ligands that bind
To the metal that's central in space.

Copper's nark — it's the beans that he's spilling:
A villain who doubles his killing.
By selling a peeler
Some info, a squealer
Can nick both a quid and a shilling.

Though angleworms aerate the soil,
Reducing the gardener's toil,
In woodlands the red ones
Should really be dead ones:
They're nearly as bad as spilled oil.

I'd be likely to suffer and moan
If my neighbors all thought me a crone.
It's a nasty old name
For a mean ugly dame.
I would surely be left all alone.

We must classify mountains of tapes
That reveal these uncivilized apes.
For the world cannot see
How the monkeys run free,
All disguised in congressional shapes.

The Coventry townsfolk got screwed
Until Lady Godiva rode nude,
Ending many a tax.
They, in thanks, turned their backs,
Save for Tom, who went blind when he viewed.

A nondescript, cabbage-clan weed?
Reserve judgement, and savor the seed
For its quality oil:
Camelina will spoil
You for others; in time it may lead.

Fannie Flagg was a hit in her day
For her wisecracks on Match Game. But, say,
Have you read what she wrote
Of some people of note
In the south at a certain cafe?

When appraising a student, the task
Is to offer support, not to bask
In one's status or knowledge.
Professors in college
Shouldn't wear an I-know-it-all mask.

Adding on is OK, but no frills!
(Evolution lacks redesign skills.)
The law's biogenetic:
Though purely cosmetic,
My embryo briefly wore gills.

TLAs—do you use them a lot?
They are all that you speak, are they not?
LOL, ADD,
PDQ, ISP?
It's acronymophilia you've got.

"Caramba!" yelled Mexican Pete,
As he galloped away down the street.
It was rather a shame
That his horse wasn't game —
So he galloped on just his two feet.

The Absolute: what have we got
On the Absolute? (Pouf!) Not a lot!
The more that we say,
The more deeply we stray
Into foolishness, fiction and rot.

Sick and tired of their King (James II)
Were the English, and therefore they reckoned
Revolution would bring
A new queen and a king.
So to William and Mary they beckoned.

A gifted researcher named Beth
Is at work on the answer to death:
It's said she's so clever
We'll soon live for ever!
Perhaps. I'm not holding my breath.

The directors are all looking worried,
As the auditors, swarming and hurried,
Re-examine our books;
And I get anxious looks
For I know where the bodies are buried.

After leaving the pet shop, Ted spied
A large grocery—squashes inside.
"For my sister-in-law,
I would like a cushaw!"
"Gesundheit!" the greengrocer cried.

Lovely Anna, invading my slumber,
Whom no inhibitions encumber:
She said I could call—
Didn't mean it at all!
Anna Nimmety gave the wrong number.

Said one box to its neighbour, "I'm vexed!
Some files that I house share the text
Of your own — makes me cry,
As I cannot see why
These in here are cross-filed in the next."

Lemon tell you, this grapefruit's not prime.
Mandarind on it's covered in slime.
It's be-kumquat abhorred,
But orange you floored
That its citrusy scent's still sublime?

Are you sad, introverted, or shy
And feel life is just passing you by?
Don't despair—there's a fix:
You must circulate, mix,
Share a joke, shake some hands — start with "Hi!"

What gives ice cubes their signature clink,
And allows them to cool off your drink?
It's a process called freezing
(Gelation), thus easing
The in-laws arrival (wink, wink).

At the end of a half-a-mile tramp
Through a wood where the ground's much too damp,
My wife, kids, and dog
And I sat on a log,
Mouth agape at the lean-to.  That's camp!

Korea was Chinese no more,
Nor Formosa's small islands offshore:
Both were lost in the fight
(Much to Nippon's delight)
In the first  Chino-Japanese War.

My opponent just gave me a nip
In my trousers, which now have a rip.
He's unbuttoned his blade,
Now I'm sorely afraid
I'll be pierced by that razor-sharp tip.

My mother considered me dumb,
Said I'd never get out of the slum
As a lawyer or doctor.
Indignant, I socked 'er.
It's heavyweight champ I've become.

Take the muzzle (that's part of a gun).
See its surface is metal? That's one
Of the senses of face.
Now that meaning's in place
All my limerick work here is done.

Today I got Overly pissed.
Yeah, O's knickers got caught in a twist
'Cause his girl I deep-kissed.
 "Stop that stat!" he loud-hissed.
But she failed to desist.  We'll persist.

If there's one thing a knight wants to be,
It's well armored, not armorless, oui?
With no garb known as mail
To protect parts so frail,
No amour in the night will he see!

I am hitchhiking (picture this scene)
On a cold but a clear Halloween.
On her broomstick, a witch
Stops and gives me a hitch;
Now we're pictured in Time Magazine.

What do children of Catholics like most?
Aliturgical days! Make a toast!
'Cause Communion's no fun
When some eagle-eyed nun
At High Mass spots you chewing the Host.

Two young cheese fans were having a chat.
Said one, "Derby's unique, and that's that!"
"Why is that, if you please?"
"It's the world's only cheese
With a name that's the same as a hat!"

From the fruit of the cucumber tree,
Filipinos get vitamin C
In a sinigang stew
Or a savory chew,
Or a chutney, a curry or tea.

At our club, is there something that's deep,
Pulling men from their homes to lose sleep?
No, it seems that the answer's
Our bottomless dancers—
And beer, 'cause the Heinies are cheap.

There's a thing I must teach you to do
In relation to tying your shoe.
The problem you're faced with:
Your footwear's been laced with
Spaghetti.  Let's start this anew.

An egotist: one who will keep
His mouth flapping for more than a peep
About how he  succeeds
In performing great deeds.
When he's talking, he's always me-deep.

A diamond's a hard precious stone,
Highly prized in a ring.  If the tone
Of your girl makes it clear
She is eager to steer
You towards one, you may need a loan.

Can she speak Anglo-Saxon, let's test her:
She knows to say Worcester or Leicester!
Though she even knows Gloucester,
She's still an impostor
From Oregon.  She's a Nor'Weicester.

Since they said my perversion was charmless
I've been trying so hard to self-harm less —
Not relieve my frustration
Through amelotation.
In truth though, I'm really quite 'armless.

If you're seen to be prejudiced, Marshal,
There'll be trouble. You'll find being harsh'll
Mean conflict and pain.
Won't you have more to gain
If you strive to be egal (impartial)?

The dress that I wore at the court
For the royal reception's the sort,
With its sequins and lace,
That would seem out of place
For my bilge-cleaning job at the port.

In the urban patois "Ain't no thing
But a..." (pause for effect) "chicken wing"
Was a slang non-event:
"Not important" it meant.
(Lasted less time than even "ka-ching.")

It's neither a slim nor a fat boat;
Just one mast and one sail — what is that boat?
And that mast ... tell me how
Come it's close to the bow?
Not a dinghy or scow, it's a catboat.

What's your astrological sign?
There are twelve of them—guess which is mine!
You can choose to believe,
Though this stuff may deceive.
If it's only for fun, then it's fine.

I'm a vital young man in my prime:
A creature of form so sublime.
Yet I've always feared Death,
Who will force my last breath,
And it's said he could come anyti

See my fingerbreadth? Not very wide.
It's perhaps half an inch side-to-side.
But it fills me with pleasure
That it serves as a measure:
No ruler, but great as a guide.

By using coaxial cable,
Your video signal's more stable.
There's less interference:
Transmission adherence
That sleeve-wrapped-round-core will enable.

We're unloading the stiffs from the trains
Day and night, as our company strains
With the pressure of burning
The corpses while turning
A profit for urning cremains.

If your doc's diagnosis has shown
Toward adrenal shortcoming you're prone,
You had better get cracking—
Aldosterone's lacking!
Take deoxycorticosterone.

Common matrimony—name to assign
To an orangy-red-berried  vine?
You may call it the tree
Of the Argyll duke's tea.
Either name for the plant will be fine.

Al-taschith, in the temple's employ,
Was a singer who gave David joy.
To the Maestro, we read,
Al-taschith. And we heed
Al by saving his psalms: "Don't destroy."

It was Alcock and Brown first of all
Who accomplished a very long haul.
The Atlantic was crossed,
Yet their record seems lost
Since it's Lindbergh that people recall.

This burlesque is outrageous and campy—
The gals are affectedly vampy.
The fellas have wrists
That are limp, and the trysts
They engage in are slutty and trampy.

It's a fallency when we admit
An exception in law—just a bit
Of particular grace
If the facts of your case
Mean the general rule doesn't fit.

Many landholders named in this book
Felt that doomsday had come. They said, "Look,
Once our wealth gets recorded,
The king is rewarded.
No change is allowed—that's the hook."

Since this building's a cylinder wrought,
Your invite's with irony fraught:
"At the angle we'll meet,"
But I fear we'll ne'er greet.
No corners are here to be sought.

MARGARET THATCHER, a master disarmer,
Was friendly and calm—no alarmer.
Charisma, allure?
She had plenty, for sure,
As this anagram shows: THAT GREAT CHARMER.

I observed Barney's car; it was smashed,
So I asked how it got to be bashed.
"Roads were icy," he cried.
"Rear end swung side-to-side—
The car fishtailed—it's then that it crashed."

Climbing up to the turret's a hassle,
But it gives a great view of your castle.
Be wise and don't gloat
You live over the moat,
Lest you rankle your serf or your vassal.

When I want metal parts for my boat
To propel it or keep it afloat,
There are more pros than cons
With aluminum bronze—
No corrosion will capture my vote.

There's a bird I have heard on a wall
That is making a harsh note or call.
Yes, its chack shows a lack
Of a musical knack;
Why, its chacking has no tune at all!

Baby bunny stretched up his full height,
Nibbling each pink petunia in sight;
While inside Poppa died,
As his family cried:
Not a banquet for Death—just a bite.

A binomial, I can discuss:
We marry two terms with no fuss.
The statistics profession
Combines this expression
In forms guaranteed to nonplus.

Stemless plants (acaulescent) abound;
It's a feature you might think unsound.
But don't rush to condemn
The low plant with no stem;
It feels much more secure on the ground.

Enticingly dressed for the part,
She beguiled him, their love-play to start.
Then he gave her that look —
"Gotta study this book!" —
Thereby putting the course 'fore the heart.

You muse, "Let the customer choose,"
Yet you're constantly out to confuse,
And you're hugely enthused
When we're duly bemused,
Since bamboozlement rules as a ruse.

I'm aroused when I'm kissed — basorthosis —
Quite a commonplace, plain diagnosis.
My barosmia spells
Out a lust for strong smells.
What I like in a girl? Halitosis!

Folks attended, way back in the day,
To what Franklin Pierce Adams would say.
He was wise: "Too much truth,"
He once said, "is uncouth,"
In a column he signed F.P.A.

A young waitress was playful and pert.
She's called baggage, a vamp, and a flirt.
I got caught in her net.
Now my wife wants to get
A divorce and give me just dessert.

It's a FIFO arrangement, so you
Have to join at the back of the queue.
First one in (there's no doubt)
Then becomes the first out
So that order and calm can ensue.

ABC is not only construed
As a network I've frequently viewed;
It's advice (somewhat brash)
Meaning "Always bring cash,"
Or it's gum that's already been chewed.

In waterside places, and warm,
Tall, bright pink flamingos will swarm.
In the water they wade,
A long-legged parade:
Such an elegant, feathery form.

Behold, now I stand at the door;
Stand and knock—open up, I implore!
Can any man hear me?
I'm hungry, and dear me,
My knuckles are swollen and sore.

We constructed a handicapped ramp
At the home of the speedwalking champ.
"This project," he said,
"Is a boondoggle, Fred."
I said, "Really? We made those at camp!"

Moses claims an acute asbestosis,
Though it isn't the right diagnosis.
Shaken up in a crash,
He is looking for cash—
It is called compensation neurosis.

A counterexample disproves
One's hypothesis, thus it behooves
You to quit with your rants
On how white guys can't dance
And get in here and check out my moves.

All gurgling and milky with slurpiness,
Baby brings up his wind in all burpiness.
Each kicking leg buckles
In time with his chuckles
As he gleefully burbles his chirpiness.

I have unfinished chores that abound,
But I goldbrick; I just laze around.
Folks don't like that I shun
Getting anything done,
So I do my best not to be found.

Your blackguardly deeds mark you out.
Philanthropical fairness you flout.
With your dastardly crew,
You're the villain we boo —
Quite a coup, for a prizewinning Scout.

In Vegas, a chapel's renowned
For its weddings, which truly astound.
Twenty knots were once tied
On a carousel ride:
An astonishing marry-go-round.

With the wrong intonation, and sparse
Use of consonants—though it's a farce—
To the depths we feel swept,
Branded fake, and inept.
We all carry the mark of our class.

Our main street is busy and wide—
Lots of people and stores on each side;
But this backstreet's serene,
Very clean and pristine,
Like a scene in which everyone's died.

Should a third person singular seek
To use do in the present, yet speak
In the past, one might say
The word doth in a way
That employs interdental technique.

This fine eighteenth-century chair
Has a bell seat, and you may compare
Its seat (shaped like a bell)
To the others we sell,
But you'll note it is not a bergère.

There are folks that you'd love to restrain
From repeating the same old refrain.
You surmise that they're done,
But—surprise!—they've begun
Once again—with the same old refrain.

I'm a fisherman, hating my role,
And leaving the life is my goal.
So, a deal with the devil:
I cheat him! I revel!
I hope he's enjoying my sole.

Could you please tone it down just a tad?
All your bickering's driving me mad.
You're at loggerheads nightly.
Try disputing politely.
Why fuss over Ziploc or Glad!

I dream of the havoc I'll wreak
In the pale shafts of moonlight, so weak.
Slanted rays form in bars,
And the smouldering stars
Glower down at me: "Whisper — don't shriek."

In Imperial Germany's day,
Member states sang the emperor's way
When it suited the whole.
Adlegation's the role
They'd demand in return for their "yay".

To compenetrate holes is my goal—
My ambition and ultimate role.
But career-wise, I'm torn.
Is fulfillment in porn
Or in jobs making plasterwork whole?

My friend Ruth said, "I must tell the truth.
Your canine is awfully uncouth!
And so dirty!" I raved,
"My dog's clean, well behaved!"
But it seems she referred to my tooth.

Mr Crabtree's just taken a pot
(With the $5 rifle he got
In the sales) at a blind
Crippled beggar—you'll find
That in every sense that's a cheap shot.

Playing third and then first, this old vet
Finished off at DH, still a threat.
Hall of Fame, Series ring,
He's the Royals' crowned king.
Did you guess his name yet? It's George Brett!

Bumper-stickering quotes means the gist
Is conveyed, but precision is missed.
Though the quotes that we know
Will turn out to be faux,
They're concise, so they're apt to persist.

Is our work trending too formulaic
And confined by conventions archaic?
While the old rules are great,
Blind obeisance can grate,
Turning poems into verses prosaic.

Your Granny knows what it's about:
"Take your coat off indoors." Never doubt
That she's right. If you don't,
Then you certainly won't
Feel its benefit when you go out.

She's unpleasant and dull as a stump,
And she's dowdy: a frowzy old  frump.
Her affection you'd shun
Since she isn't much fun,
And she'll never be called Mrs. Trump.

I retrieve my kid's lunchbox today.
(When school ended, we'd stored it away.)
I unbuckle the flap
To find two-month-old crap:
A fossilized PB&J.

A convector's a heater that blows
Hot air upward (by buoyance), which flows
Towards the ceiling to heat
The next-story guy's feet—
While my own toes, last night, almost froze!

A young monk, gabby Lou, won't employ
Meditation; this tends to annoy.
The head monk dressed him down.
Contrite Lou, with a frown,
Cried, "Hey, abbot, I've been a bad boy!"

One maxim of poker is true,
So remember, whatever you do:
At each table there's one
Who will soon be undone.
If you can't spot the sucker, it's you.

It's the letter that comes after d.
It's a note in a musical key.
It's a vitamin, grade,
And a number. Arrayed
In this verse are five meanings of e.

In England, at Bletchley, they tried
To decipher dense codes. Then they'd hide
Their success when they could.
Thus, the Germans still would
Think advantage remained on their side.

See those actresses looking their best
At the Oscars?  I'm very impressed
That they're dressed to the nines
In their Gucci designs,
Even more so when showing some chest.

A scheming young student named Scott
Tried to take out more cash than he'd got.
When his bank card was swallowed,
He panicked and followed.
He's stuck till they widen the slot.

That a girl's polyandrous implies
That she's mated with two or more guys.
Is diandrous our cue
That she'd screw only two?
No! A plant with two stamens. Surprise!

North of Clyde and of Forth, there they dwelt,
In this realm, auld, the Pict, and the Celt.
Fair was  Alban of name,
And so, much to their shame,
Before Sassenach Kings they soon knelt.

When up to the dock Guy's boat glided,
Its list to the port was decided.
It was marked and so strong
That his steering went wrong;
With our catamaran, Guy collided.

You're acerbic, from what I can see.
You're as bitter as bitter can be.
I know that your life
Is abounding with strife,
But quit whining about it to me.

A jumper, when wind he detects,
His parachute's course he corrects.
In accuracy jumping,
Adrenalin's pumping
Until his touch-down on the X.

A brown creeper loves snacking on all
Tiny spiders and insects that crawl
On the tree he ascends
(With the bark his coat blends).
He's a bird that is threatened (and small).

I buy fancy smoked salmon for Todd.
It arrives in a box and smells odd.
What's contained in the box?
Cod (Atlantic) — no lox!
Me and Todd, we are screwed with the scrod.

"Are you mostly in tune with her?" "Yes."
"Go along with her… likewise?" "No less.
We are two of a kind.
Seem to be of one mind.
Seeing eye to eye helps that, I guess."

There were brains all about the abode.
This cerebric material showed
That the victim was not
Simply bludgeoned or shot—
Something caused this guy's head to explode!

The Islands we know as Aleutian
Are American mostly, some Roo-sian.
Two large nations thus care
For Aleuts who live there—
It's a peaceable joint contribution.

They lived eons ago—the Cretaceous—
An era when life wasn't gracious.
Though their kind didn't last,
These small raptors were fast,
And their appetites truly rapacious.

I've created a judgment provider,
Makes me feel like a White House insider.
It's a coin, shows George Bush,
Front, his face; back, his tush —
That bad penny will be my decider!

Golden-ager, that's quite euphemistic
For the old folks (and rather simplistic).
I'm old and still bold,
But my head sports no gold —
It looks silver, and that's realistic.

In love with her right from the start,
I foolishly offered my heart.
Being hers to abuse,
With the heels of her shoes
She contused it and tore it apart.

My son David quite often will crave
Chocolate cake; it's his absolute fave.
It's the food he likes best
And he gives me no rest
Till I've baked one.  He makes me his slave.

Charientism: barb veiled in grace,
Delivered with smiles, face-to-face—
An insult quite clever
By which you endeavor
To reprove with a verbal embrace.

Calvin's courtliness made Cousin Meg
Want to take old Cal down just a peg,
As he seemed insincere,
Saying, "Marg'ret, me dear,
Those sheer hose really flatter your leg."

It's a form of elliptical speaking
To end with "and all." If you're seeking
The same sort of tone
For which Caulfield is known,
Use this phrase. (Be prepared for critiquing.)

My boss is a boob and a boor,
One whose manners are worse than just poor.
You might ask, with this slob,
Why I stay on the job.
It's the six-figure paycheck, I'm sure.

If there's aught that one ought to be taught,
It's  the true definition of aught.
It means "anything; something,"
Which may be a rum thing
To those who confuse it with naught.

I, by flouting near every convention,
Stay the center, each day, of attention.
This constant attraction
Gives great satisfaction
(But causes dissension, I'd mention).

Homer Simpson's a fellow who'll grow
On you slowly, but markedly so.
He's completely uncool,
Plays the barking mad fool,
With his signature catchphrase of "D'oh!"

God gave humans their mamas to hug 'em,
And heartstrings so people could tug 'em.
But to balance that joy,
God did this to annoy:
He created Insecta to bug 'em.

I must place Himalaya's chilled yeti
On Africa's baked Serengeti,
A sweltering clime,
But the only fit rhyme
For a yeti poetically petty.

My son is disabled and might
Go to court and engage in a fight.
He's got a contracture;
Its cause was a fracture
His doctor just didn't set right.

She's cosmetically challenged, poor thing;
And she looks like a clown on a fling.
Every day's Halloween
For this rosy-cheeked queen,
Over-perfumed and covered in bling.

The new job that her lover has taken
Left the maiden abandoned and shaken.
She complains every day
That he lives  far away.
She's bereft since he left—she's forsaken.

To crochet, all you need is a hook
And some yarn, and then maybe a book
That will indicate which
Place and manner to stitch,
With a picture of how it should look.

Our new fishing boat, out on her maiden
(First) voyage, for bait fish—menhaden,
Rode so low with her load,
Only deadworks she showed
(What's in view when a ship's fully laden).

I was taught how to spot a good deal
By my mom, but I totally feel,
With small items, that I've
Got a better way: five-
Finger discounts.  They're grabbed for a steal.

"Cut my booze?" cried the gin-soaked ol' coot.
"Save the water for bathin' in. Shoot,
If a liquor, I think,
Is befittin' to drink,
Then, by God, it's too good to dilute!"

Like a nuclear wolf, I am glowing,
Or perhaps there's a deer in me growing.
It's fauna, not flora,
Controlling my aura.
My animal spirit is showing.

Mr Grace, the headmaster, is dead.
I've been tasked, as the deputy head,
To act up in his place.
Which is nice. Mrs Grace
Is a fox — bet she's kinky in bed...

A specific sub-species of bloke
Was a -gory: a -gill or a -gloak.
(James H. Vaux, who loved spinnin' 'em,
Says it's their synonym:
English, mate, as she were spoke.)

With only one chance to explore
The nightlife, we went door to door
To each pub on the street
Downing drinks as we'd meet
All those barflies who barhop still more.

Fact assimilability's key
To succeeding, I think you'll agree.
For if you can absorb
Lots of stuff in your orb
Then a Jeopardy! champ you can be.

When I got to his lab, all his gear
And his chemicals filled me with fear.
"Watch me make Bengal light;
It warns sailors at night."
(Geez, I thought it was some kind of beer!)

With King Henry VIII, here's the thing:
While it's true that some wives felt the sting
Of the axman's cruel blade,
By these acts I'm unswayed.
My heart always goes out to the king.

"What big tubelike monstrosity's this?"
"It's a fuel grain, for space shuttles, miss."
"Something's wrong with your brain.
How's that huge thing a grain?"
"Why ask me? You're the brains, surely, sis."

A true astral plane always flies,
Though not in conventional skies,
But with mystical grace
Through ethereal space
In a deep astrological guise.

Ten sticks' worth of eels is a bind;
Twenty-five in each stick. You will find
If you're counting these eels
What a bounty of meals
With an eely appeal you've aligned!

I'll be charging the jury today
As to law, and to what they should weigh.
It's a task I hold dear.
Jurors' jobs must be clear,
And this judge never leads them astray.

Lighten up, Hon, you look broken-hearted.
You've glimpsed his first sketch—he's just started.
That's a basic esquisse;
Give the artist some peace.
That expression! Like someone's just farted.

Aware that a rumour's been mooted,
They know all the details are rooted
In truth—since their toiling,
Entwining and coiling
Showed hugs have become convoluted.

Jeannie's child from Château-la-Vallière
(European and French) and raised there
At a Jesuit school,
Neither genius nor fool:
Pierre (that's me) chevalier de Taillefer.

Not for humans, is cottonseed cake.
It's reserved for their livestock.  First, take
All the oil from the seeds
(Save to meet other needs):
You'll have meal—but no cottonseed steak.

Ricky worked as a devil last winter
Due to skills he had shown as a sprinter.
As an errand boy, Rick
Made a point to be quick
With the tasks he performed for a printer.

I'm afraid of a cancer's detection;
And seeing a mirror's reflection;
To sit on my booty;
And feminine beauty;
And everyone's laughing rejection.

J. Caesar set Rome as his quest.
"The die has been cast," he expressed.
With the Rubicon crossed,
Other options were tossed—
Truly, alea iacta iam est.

A raccoon may look cute, but take care;
You may want to make friends, but beware;
Seems benign (in your yard),
But don't let down your guard:
A coon's nasty, has claws — it's a bear!

This appropriator dressed all in black
Is both cunning and swift to attack
Any object that's bright;
And he crows with delight
From his nest.  No, he won't bring it back.

Nantucket, an island at sea,
Is a place quite unique, you'll agree,
Blest by Limerick's fame
Just because of its name —
Oh, crap! I've forgotten Dundee!

Quite collectedly gathering his wits,
When his pupils were giving him fits,
The sub calmly declared,
"Time for recess," and snared
Their affection in one brilliant blitz.

A companion, old Rome would've said,
Is a person with whom you break bread.
But our more recent ways
Favor overnight stays—
And she'll likely want breakfast in bed.

Reproduction in fungi? Two ways:
Anamorph on asexual days,
Wherein budding's the norm,
So condidia form,
Unlike teleo's sexual phase.

My captress, a woman named Kate,
Set her trap using cheesecake as bait.
Then she locked me away
For a week and a day—
The most fun that I've had on a date.

Look out at that weird apparition.
It drifts o'er the lawn sans cognition.
Its clothing's in tatters
And, not that it matters,
It can't have enjoyed good nutrition.

They dug deep (what seemed halfway to hell),
Then they formed a cylindrical shell:
Rings of concrete, not brick,
Was their principal trick.
The result of their efforts? Faired well.

Crystal Mangum cried "rape" with a tide
Of the media taking her side.
So how could it be
That the Duke lacrosse three
Were then cleared of all charges?  She lied.

Our policeman was called PC Plod,
And I thought him a bit of a clod.
But the real fool was me,
'Cos in secrecy, he
Was a part of the Yard's 'Flying Squad'.

It means "bushy." But prone to verbosity,
I'll say that this plant has dumosity.
The word dumous, in fact,
Means, moreover, "compact."
These old words are a rare curiosity.

My dear, you're so very caressable.
My love is so strong it's professable.
Are my feelings based much
On your softness of touch?
I can't tell; this just isn't assessable.

"All our wealth for the poor, that's our charter.
My freedom's not worth coin nor barter."
The Vikings, dismayed
That they wouldn't be paid,
In a rage killed St. Alphege the Martyr.

"Atonal," A. Schoenberg averred,
"Is a perfectly horrible word.
Though I dare, if you please,
To write songs without keys,
Writing songs without tones is absurd."

A culicid's sort of a gnat,
Or mosquito, or something like that.
For its biting to fail
You must put on a veil,
And avail yourself, now, of a bat.

When your lyrics are all "la-la-la"s,
Your recording may still earn hurrahs
From your fans. A release
By the group The Police
Was a hit filled with "De"s, "Do"s, and "Da"s.

Do you feel neither sadness nor joy?
Don't you love your own son? My dear boy,
You're disnatured, I fear.
The position is clear;
You're the perfectly un-real McCoy.

Renée Fleming: the beauty and grace
Of her acting, her figure and face,
And her flexible voice
Make this diva my choice.
Among singers, she merits first place.

There once was a gal, Shelly Sutton,
With an eye-catching, strange belly button.
She endured navel battle
'Til a surgeon said, "That'll
Be fixed with some quick belly cuttin'."

"At conception? It's then life begins?"
Asked the maiden who's carrying twins.
"My conception is this—
That life starts with a kiss,
Then it spins, full of gin, to its sins."

Our Strictly Come Dancing defeat
Could hardly have been more complete:
Not one telephone vote!
Even Len said (I quote),
"It's just you and your clodhopping feet!"

When I'm wearing my blue fishing cap,
And the waves 'gainst my boat gently lap,
In the water I drop
Down my bait with a plop—
This is how seasoned fishermen dap.

Eschewing the norms, the conventional,
Our son is becoming descensional:
On a steep sinking slope,
Thanks to drinking and dope,
His downslide is clearly intentional.

A neophyte nun sits before
A mirror.  She hopes to restore
A flawless complexion.
Astringent perfection
Is needed when helping the pore.

While many a farmer will sow garlic
And for cooking and selling will grow garlic,
There's an "avian" type
That escapes all the hype.
More an onion grown wild, it's crow garlic.

Emotionlessly raising his bow,
Robin coolly took aim, then let go,
Missed the sheriff's fat head,
Hit a scarecrow instead,
But then, Brit-like, still said, "Damned good show."

On TV, these experienced actors
Play surgeons. Some relevant factors
Are their talents with tools,
So they don't look like fools
Pulling tonsils or teeth with extractors.

Major Anderson's holding the fort
As he's waiting for Union support.
A bombardment will bring
Quick surrender—good thing
That this Civil War battle is short.

What pointless objectives we've sought!—
Lost causes, all efforts for naught.
We prefer not to gripe,
But we're hunting a snipe,
And red herring is all that we've caught.

The cinnabar moth's black-and-red
Is a warning to birds: eat the head
Or the body and wings
Of these elegant things—
Taste's so nasty, you'd wish you were dead.

At a palace one sultry July
Near Paree, a jeune fille caught my eye.
She bewitched me that day
And I fell right away
En amour. It was love at Versailles.

You're back from your summer vacation
Still looking like Ahab's cetacean.
Have you partied all night,
And then slept when it's light?
That accounts for your etiolation.

Here's a tidbit of HTML:
Say goodbye to the lame table cell
And hello to the <div>.
This container will give
You more options for styling it well.

On TV, silly bloopers we watch
Of some actors and lines that they botch
Plus the clips of some guys
Letting loose with their cries
Of great pain when they're hit in the crotch.

In the blackness of Allhallows Eve,
Ghouls and goblins have gathered to weave
Fearsome plots, fiendish schemes,
Haunting spells, daunting dreams,
All to make disbelievers believe.

Who's the best sorta bushranger? Well, 'e
Should have a good story to tell: 'e
Should start out a farmer,
Go stealing in armour,
Then stoush the police—like Ned Kelly.

You will find, if you're highly renowned,
Paparazzi keep sniffing around,
But a worse cur, I think,
And a mutt who craves ink,
Is the darned dogged autograph hound.

With newer technologies steaming
Ahead, I'm dragged kicking and screaming.
No use fighting the force
Of the future.  The course
To the past just exists when I'm dreaming.

Whooper, black, black-necked, mute, tundra (spawn
Of two species), and trumpeter swan
Look like cursive-style Q
Or the numeral 2:
Swimming Cygnus that graze on my lawn.

Well, I've viewed it and here's the straight poop:
Your new DVD disc is a dupe.
It's a poorly made copy
With audio choppy
And video clear as pea soup.

Two letters together: AK?
It's the code for Alaska, I'd say,
Or a guy who'll kiss asses,
And then, as time passes,
Alter kocker becomes, and will stay.

Botanical terms have their fads
(For taxonomists like to be lads),
But dolabrate's one
That was not coined for fun:
It means "having the shape of an adze".

We have dumped early meanings for dump:
To fall fast; to fling down with a whump;
A brown study; sad song.
Also gone (just like sprong):
In amazement, and doughily plump.

Soundproof walls to stop noise from each yell;
Charcoal filters to cut sulfur's smell;
Wind- and sun-powered fires;
Emission-free pyres;
TV and free wifi as well.

The fellows were playing stud poker;
The game was intense, a real smoker.
With deft sleight of hand
William fooled them, as planned—
He'd anted with Phil's chips, the joker.

I thought orienteering was crap;
I was right, and I'm now in a flap.
With some tor I've a tryst
On this moor, in the mist…
I deperditely glare at my map.

A doctrine once held it was fair
For two viewpoints, opposing, to air;
But that mandate's passé.
We don't need it today
With the number of outlets out there.

It's a cardiac bypass for me,
So they'll open my rib cage and see
If my blood flow increases
And heart pain surceases
From doing this CABG.

Bits of lining escape from your womb
To a place where, unwelcome, they bloom.
When your menses provoke
Them to swell, then they poke
With more pain than a bloke might assume.

To astrogate's not to step through
An alien arch to pursue
Strange forces fanatical
With fate problematical.
Instead, steer your spacecraft with crew.

No, Mother, I will not stay quiet!
I'm proud that I'm on the "ape diet":
Nuts and veggies and beans,
Lots of fruit and fresh greens.
With the shape that you're in, you should try it!

Transduction's a process in genes.
Cotransduction is, too, but it means
That two markers are packed
In a virus—in fact,
You might say they're genetic sardines.

A geiger detects radiation
That's the cause of gas ionization.
And to say that it counts
Little "geigers" amounts
To what linguists would call back-formation.

An anion carries a charge,
And the cations come to enlarge
It by forming a cluster
Like a covering lustre,
Moving straight to the anode side's marge.

When the waiter arrived with my dish
(Which was angel hair topped with grilled fish),
I hissed, "Sir, you're not fair.
I chose pasta, not hair!
Was a meal à la eyelash my wish?"

"We've arrived! Take a look at Utopia!
But you squint. What's it, Clint—hyperopia?"
"No, not farsighted trouble;
My eyes—they see double."
"Two Edens? My God, it's diplopia!"

Let us strive for egality, brothers.
None shall have greater powers than others.
Those wishing to fight us
Are simply detritus—
We'll give a "fair shake" to these mothers!

At that party, I spoke without tact:
Dropped a brick.  Social graces I lacked.
Indiscreetly, I blurted
Some things quite perverted.
Freed genies we cannot redact.

Though I've won twenty million,  I shout
That it won't be plain sailing, no doubt.
Now I've joined the jet-setters,
What about begging letters?
Should I just keep on sending them out?

There's a sculptural form or motif
So obtrusive it's giving me grief.
I prefer watching TiVo
To alto-relievo.
At least there's some comic relief.

When I'm petting my dog, he enchants,
With his coat a soft, shiny expanse.
But what's not so enchanting —
His constant loud panting.
In brief: love his coat, hate his pants.

A breatharian's mealtime fixation:
No solids or liquids. Translation:
"'Eating' only the air—
There's a holy life there!"
(Or, more likely, he'll die of starvation.)

Since my adjutancy, things have gone well;
This batallion, henceforth, will excel:
No more chicken-shit rules.
My procedures? All jewels,
So is input invited? Like hell!

In my Volkswagen Beetle, I chug
Up a hill, and I know it must bug
All the drivers behind,
But this auto's designed
To be frugal...and I to be smug.

Hippocrates wrote, "Art is long,
Life is short." "Sweats are bad when they're strong."
His brisk definitions —
Physicians' tuitions —
The first aphorisms written (a throng).

Conversing in bars was normality
Till the smoking ban hit this locality.
Are they joking? "No smoking"
Provoking our soaking
Is choking our conviviality.

My opponent has heatedly stressed
My proposals are useless at best,
And upon me he's gloomily
Heaping contumely
(Apodioxis, I've guessed).

I'd been walking on air all my life
When one night I heard this from my wife:
"I just cannot extol
Your technique, on the whole."
(Innuendo can cut like a knife.)

Asa dulcis is sweet to the nose,
And that's where it typically goes.
Brown tears for perfume
That can incense a room,
In a jar, will grow benzoin's rose.

Amnioscopy, one would assume,
Will allow us (with lenses that zoom)
To encounter the face
Of the kid we'll embrace
When it finally vacates the womb.

Saying "Cobblers!" not linked to the shoe,
Just means "Nonsense!" and probably grew
From the term cobbler's awls
(Cockney rhyme slang for balls),
Though no doubt some will say, "That's not true!"

A penguin in southernmost seas
Where thinner-skinned seabirds would freeze
Is called an Adelie.
It plays ukulele
And swallows the fishies with ease.

Decretal epistles reply
To ecclesiasts wondering "Why?"
The Pope checks the laws
Of the Church, hems and haws,
Then decrees "It's because!" from on high.

My boyfriend is somebody who
I often make fun of, it's true,
In my limerick writing.
I find it inviting
To share all his foibles; don't you?

Naked under his overcoat (stark!),
Says the flasher, one night, in the park:
"Now you see! Now you don't!
Now you see!" — No, you won't,
For the flasher is veiled in the dark.

Though he loves spending time with our boys,
Their big daddy can't handle their noise.
Once he's fit to be tied,
Grandma moves them outside;
Pop returns to his man cave and toys.

See the eparch, serene on his perch,
In the Eastern (or Orthodox) Church.
He's akin to a bishop.
(That's all I can dish up:
There's more, but I'd have to research.)

"She's a looker," the waiter said chattily.
"Love her suit. She's attired so nattily.
She's got style and flair,
And such beautiful hair."
"She's a hooker," the guest replied cattily.

A dorkus is someone uncool:
Someone silly, a doofus, a fool,
Not the Dorcas in Acts,
As described in the tracts
They give out in parochial school.

How does Biden, the patriot, feel?
"Kate, it's time to be part of the deal...
Help America out
Of the rut."  He's about
Redistributing income with zeal.

In a process that's called chain migration,
My father had come to this nation,
Found work and a town,
Where like folk settled down.
Then came family reunification.

Hey, copper, these cuffs are too tight
On my wrists; dude, I ain't gonna fight.
I got nowhere to run
And you sucked all the fun
From my drunk and debaucherous night.

Tom's cheering was really dramatic,
His team support clearly emphatic.
As they put up a score
He would stand up and roar.
Said Tom rabidly, "I'm a fanatic!"

She has foul-in-the-foot, does this cow.
That's some foul-smelling foot rot — and how!
She acquired foul, alas,
When she pastured in grass
And in leaves that were wet — treat her now!

To keep infantry marching in line,
Martial common time rhythm is fine.
Those four beats to the bar
Help young marchers march far:
Look for C, its time signature sign.

With the candidates straddling the fence,
And the voters incurably dense,
Our election looms, ominous,
For lack of more commonness
In misleadingly named common sense.

The ammonites swam in the sea
Around four hundred million B.C.
'Til their elegant shells
Settled under the swells;
Now they're fossilized mollusc debris.

The balls from their guns are okay—
All my clothing is ballproof, but they
Aim an arrow at me.
Now I'm aiming to flee;
I just don't see the point, not today.

"Here's the bottom-line question I've got,"
Said the judge, "sir, and don't tell me rot:
Did you grab her and kiss
This unfortunate Miss
And afterwards rape her or not?"

Winter ice on my window: etched frostwork,
Fine filigree glazing — God's glost-work!
Night's delicate crazing
In crystal — amazing!
Dawn's morning rays blazing... now, lost work.

You've got acorn disease? You're a tree.
That's what my diagnosis would be.
You're no oak, you say? Shoot!
It turns out you're a fruit?
Well, that's surely a new one on me!

A sea specked with islands once came—
As the mountain range on 'em—to fame,
Like a capital of state,
To be named, what a fate,
After Otto von…?, von What's-his-name.

The Wicked One works through bad seeds,
Which are placed among good.  They're like weeds,
But when harvest arrives
And they learn who survives,
They'll regret that they did evil deeds.

Adrenaline makes you adepter
And ready to fight, not inepter,
When your instinct's defense.
How's your brawn made to tense?
By your alpha-adrenergic receptor.

Boanthropy: a mental disease
Where the victim, as big as you please,
Behaves like an ox
And repeatedly shocks
All his friends as he hauls away trees!

Achoo syndrome can give you a fright:
Such sneezing from seeing the light!
It's genetically passed,
And since it may last
They'll "Gesundheit! Gesundheit!" your plight.

Jimmy Gilmer sang lead with his pack
Called The Fireballs.  The song "Sugar Shack"
Topped the charts.  The top ten
Didn't happen again
Till, with "Bottle of Wine," they came back.

Glasgow Celtic play football in green;
They are famous from Tashkent to Tignes.
Their fans welcome strangers,
Unless they're from Rangers,
Whose reception is frankly obscene.

Our circus has come to Death Valley.
(Dehydration is right up our alley.)
Twenty clowns you will see
In a car—no A/C!
For a finish, that's quite a finale.

Encephalography has several kinds.
One type reads people's brains (not their minds).
There electrodes are placed
On the scalp where they're spaced
Such that printouts form clearly, one finds.

Astronomical twilight reveals
What a brighter sky background conceals,
Though the Milky Way's glow
Is unlikely to show
Over street lights and automobiles.

King of gods, mighty Zeus the august,
Took the fair nymph Callisto in lust.
But now Jupiter's got 'er
(That rank Roman rotter!),
Though she's wrinkled these days — an old crust.

There once was a good man from Bree—
The invincible horse now can see—
To riddle, to cry—
My dear, please don't lie—
Oh, no! I must have ADD!

Draw two lines across cheques that you pay.
Crossed like this, it's a shorthand to say:
"This is not for exchange,
Just deposit." Arrange
That you make every payment this way.

Sun with rays ending smoothly in hands
Is a sign that for Him only stands:
One god, Aten, self-made
By a pharaoh who paid
With his life for his god in the sands.

On a jamb of our door daubed with skill
Is the nest of an insect, there still.
Though of mud it is built,
We could not bear the guilt
Of clearing away with a kill.

Procedural or adjective law
Charts the route from the figurative door,
Legalistically speaking,
To the judgement you're seeking:
Guides the court what to show or ignore.

Gilbertian operas: I favour
The improbable, whimsical flavour
Of each lyric, each word,
In those plots so absurd —
And with patience, it's all there to savour.

A black widow's a spider that's able
To slaughter her mate (hence the label).
Right after they mate,
It's the end of the date.
(Hey, at least he puts food on the table.)

Start a blog!  Mine's a great golden goose,
Which takes no sweat at all to produce.
In less than one year
I saw money appear.
Takes no effort at all.  Just hang loose!

At Lake Garda I spotted a guard.
He was smoking some hash; I was jarred.
"Irish copper!" I slurred,
"Smoking garda? Absurd!"
Shushed the garda: "You'll get us both barred!"

As Britney launched into her song,
She wore nothing below but a thong.
Her derriere's airier;
The male fans merrier:
They like how she strings them along.

"Bits and Pieces" by pop's Dave Clark Five
And "Because" make me sing when I drive.
"Do You Love Me" (so fine),
"Can't You See That She's Mine",
"Glad All Over" were great when played live.

In my yard, there's a daw who's a thief,
And he's clever beyond all belief.
This jackdaw swooped down,
Heading right for my crown,
Grabbed my toupe for his nest—caused me grief!

Howler monkeys aloft in a tree,
Burst upon by a simian she,
Gave a hoot, in duet,
"We were startled, and yet
Won't regret a ménage of we three."

We know robins have breasts that are red,
And are brown on the back and the head,
But some robins, it's true,
On their breasts display blue,
So we call them blue robins instead.

A fall's also known as a pin
If a wrestling ring you are in.
In the course of attack,
Hold the other guy's back
To the mat for two seconds—you win.

My mom's busting her buttons right now,
Rightly proud of her son, I'll allow.
I can tie my own shoes
Any time that I choose,
And it took only fifty years—wow!

"Hey, check out her bacon and eggs!"
This, in London, means "Look at her legs."
It's a slang term, like pins,
Meaning "thighs, knees, and shins,"
Just like gams, stocking-stuffers, and pegs.

In the shadows, while Dracula keeps
A dark vigil, the heroine sleeps.
To her neck he draws near.
I get gooseflesh. It's clear
That these bedroom scenes give me the creeps.

The heading of wheat starts to show.
Soon there's flowering; seeds will soon grow
Soft and milky. And then
It's the dough stage; that's when
We determine the state of the dough.

"Its colours take root in the earth,
With the shades of the winter's rebirth."
So it goes, all the artspeak,
But hearing the heart speak,
They're thinking they know what it's worth.

What an angel she was, perched on high.
On her morals we all could rely.
But with Paul she's been ballin' —
That angel has fallen.
She's badly behaved with that guy.

"This will clear up your skin," read the ad
(All the itching was driving her mad).
The stuff stank—it was rank,
But her rash quickly shrank,
And she never found out what she had.

MacTavish, that cadgy old Scot,
Drinks up shot after shot after shot,
Then starts making passes
At sweet bonny lasses,
Singing, "Ach, what a grand life I've got!"

Though the anarchist hated the system
(Its authorities thoroughly pissed 'im),
When his targets were dead
And his mayhem caused dread,
He discovered his weakness—he missed 'em.

I met Liz, and I'm now in a tizzy.
I'm reeling, vertiginous, dizzy.
Though my brain's MRI
Shows that nothing's awry,
All its cells must be spinning for Lizzie!

An abacost's worn in Zaire.
It covers not toe and not ear.
A collarless shirt
And loose pants (not a skirt)—
A man's suit (and hot weather gear).

My cotton supply now is gone;
Little doubt what he's using it on.
My two-year-old's evil:
The Toilet Bowl Weevil
Prefers it for clogging the john.

As the diners are donning their bibs
At the barbeque place, I have dibs
On the pork platter (yum!),
Because no one can come
Between me and my baby back ribs.

You're an airhead who's dorky, and thus
You are foolish and doltish. Don't cuss.
Now, your underwear goes
On your ass, not your nose —
Stick your legs in the holes and don't fuss.

When dining with old Chinese friends,
Your ineptness with chopsticks offends.
Using forkchops, however,
May make you look clever.
There's a fork and a knife at the ends.

Though both hide in the leaves while you're hiking,
A rattlesnake warns before striking;
But a copperhead lurks
For an ambush, and smirks.
Such treachery's not to my liking.

If bronchitis is making you ill,
There's a tree called amapa that will
Cure your ailment (hurrah!),
While you'll find Amapá
Is a state in northeastern Brazil.

To remove lines of text in a flash:
Control-X you can press (not the dash).
The words will be cut
To be pasted soon. But
This is not like deleting to trash.

I got chops.  On the sax, I'm the tops.
All my fans, they be givin' me props.
Then some fool say, "Oh, no!
When you blow, man, you blow!"
So I busted the dude in the chops.

"Here's your quiz, and the questions, again, are:
What's a deni? How many's a denar?"
"Mr. Wizard, that's trivia!"
Cried my classmate, Olivia.
"It's a guy thing," said I, "That's how men are."

OEDILF provides standards and guidelines.
Join in, don't just sit on the sidelines.
Good rhymes, jokes, and meter?
Your limerick's much sweeter!

Wilf workshops OEDILF as Miss Whiffy
With comments regarded as iffy.
Once again on the whine,
His critique gives the sign
The old chap is decidedly squiffy.

My ancestors liked to take shots
Of nieces and nephews, and pots!
They all liked the tint
Of an albumen print...
"So whose turn to shoot? Let's draw lots!"

Annexationists love to annex
Others' lands; like huge reptiles, they vex
And devour their neighbors,
Whose primary labor's
To thwart the designs of T. Rex.

She sat scared in her cell. It was black,
And not one ray of light pierced a crack.
It was black as the Earl
Of Hell's waistcoat; the girl
Let loose tears that could not be held back.

You are telling me, friend, my salvation
Is determined by God Corporation —
And not by one God?
By god, that is odd!
I am getting a hellish sensation.

You may think that a bowler's a hat,
But in cricket it's nothing like that.
It's a man whose main aim
Is to finish the game
By dismissing the man with the bat.

This poor hen's received no acclamation,
No applauding, no strong commendation,
For eggs laid standing up,
Nicely dropped in a cup.
Clap for Cluck and her standing ovation!

Sometimes craterization of tissue
Is required when infection's an issue.
Told my doc,  "I can tell
You depressed my flesh well;
Were you one tad less ugly, I'd kiss you."

Pork sausage and ham, thinly sliced,
Onions, taters, and barley — enticed?
It's called coddle.  No troublin'
The cooks up in Dublin;
They'll serve up this dish lightly spiced.

Queen Elizabeth granted a charter
To the Institute, which as a starter
In the practice of quality
Well served all her polity—
This acronym simply looks smarter.

Obsolete is this word, that I know.
It used to mean "husband", although
He must have had nous,
For he mastered his house,
But he's gone, yes it's go, goman, go.

As I said to a speaker of Romani,
"Tom Middleton coined words uncommon.  He
Flung insults so rude
Like 'O, base mullipood!'
He'd call you, I expect, babliaminy."

If you love to save trash, you're not dreckless.
Your cars crash? Then you're reckless, not wreckless.
(So folks will raise heck less,
I'll rhyme less with eckless —
Like, things with no spots; they're spot…fleckless.)

While two men were out walking abreast,
They debated whose torso looked best.
Said Arnold, "It's mine!"
Leading Tarzan to whine,
"No, it's mine!" and start thumping his chest.

In Berlin, ever-present's the past.
Monumentally, memories last,
Lest they're lost, cast in stone.
Fathers' sins they atone,
In their House, so reflectively glassed.

"Come to tea? Sorry, can't," he replied.
"I must go to poor Bunbury's side."
Thus did freedom depend
On a made-up sick friend.
When he bunburied, frankly, he lied.

Any man of weak intellect, son,
Is a dodipoll, wiser than none.
Link your fortunes to him
Who is foolish and dim
And your problems have only begun.

That bone-setter better desist
From persistently twisting my wrist.
He insists he's not jokin':
My bonelets are broken—
But I'm pissed, so watch out for my fist!

No confusing that scolding, accusing,
Surly stare—you don't find it amusing,
Having asked me to say
If you look fat today,
That I'm choosing to sit here, refusing.

Her grooming last winter was lax.
At the mirror now, not wearing slacks,
She alerts her salon:
"With this bathing suit on,
I am fimbriate—time for a wax!"

We went car camping out in the wood:
First we drove just as far as we could,
Pitched our tent by a brook,
And that's all that it took:
Then we chilled, as vacationers should.

Causimomancy claims that an omen
Can be gleaned if you manage to home in
On the rate objects burn
In a fire. (I discern
A bad hair day—I just tossed my comb in.)

Though he'd never shown panic states priorly,
Sy begged urgently, pressingly, direly.
He was calling from jail,
Asking cash for his bail,
Which would eat up my savings entirely.

"How I wish every date who's a cutie
Had this trait: a devotion to duty.
I'd convince her to mate,
That it's duty, equate
It with fate."  "Mate, that line is a beauty!"

The accent of Digorie Phelps—
So far back! Meaning scalps, he says 'skelps'.
His collection has rets'
Hair, and hemsters' and bets'.
(You don't have to be mad, but it helps.)

If you're breathing azote, and it's pure,
For five minutes or more, I am sure
You'll be crossing the Styx
From a nitrogen fix,
But for pests that infest, it's a cure.

"She's gone out to find pot, I suppose.
Would my daughter do elsewise?" asked Rose
In a quavering voice.
"She'd make no other choice.
I'm sure rehab is not what she chose."

My bedroom set (oak) wuz too plain,
So's I hired dis Danish guy, Blaine,
To go tinge it all red.
"Yer a moron," he said.
He distained it, dis Dane, wid disdain.

The expression S2 – S
Can be factored: there's no need to guess.
S and (S – 1)
Are its factors, my son.
It has factorability, yes.

San Francisco's mass transit, to me,
Is a huge disappointment.  I see
That no cable car has
Such amenities as
I'd expected, like cable TV.

In Texas they have some dark soil;
To work it requires much toil.
This gumbo's like goo,
And it might seem to you
This blackland is dirt mixed with oil.

Filing down the occasional tooth
Can restore the appearance of youth
To a horse, as you know.
It's called bishoping, though,
If you don't tell the buyer the truth.

I see bushtits arrive in a bunch,
And they land on tall weeds to have lunch:
Two or three on each, so
The plants bend very low;
The birds hang upside down while they munch.

His lament gave us all quite a jolt:
"I'm a moron, a fool; I'm a dolt!
Asked my teacher, 'Lahore
Was involved in what war?'
I replied, 'In the Call Girl Revolt.'"

Abulic means "lacking in will",
An affliction that sadly is still
A most common trait
In those folks who hate
To put in more effort than nil.

With zigzags and curves you contend.
As you drive down the road you depend
On a sign to appear
When a dogleg is near.
That's a turn with a very sharp bend.

The large wrought iron stars on that wall
Are called anchor plates. No, they won't fall.
Reinforcements or bracing,
They true the stone facing.
Must have worked: there they hang, after all.

Dholl are yellow split peas. There's a stew
Mauritanians make—you might too!
It has garlic and ghee,
Salt and turmeric, see?
Now some chilli... That ruined it! Ew!

My chapeau hasn't come yet; it should
Have arrived by last Monday; it could
Have perhaps gone astray?
In which case, I shall say,
"Please refund all my money; make good."

Whether constant or just episodic,
If your bowel sounds aren't melodic,
And you sometimes will howl
From a cramp, and cry foul,
What you need is an antispasmodic.

"It's a venomous snake bite," said Nurse.
"You need treatment, or things will get worse;
This acanthin injection
Will fight the infection,
And avoid any need for a hearse."

Cherophobia sufferers say,
"We get anxious when happy or gay."
Fear of gaiety? True!
It could happen to you.
Play it safe and get glummer today.

There's this most useful madder, the kind
With a root that yields dye when refined.
Alizari's the plant
From the region Levant.
Dyes from test tubes have since been designed.

My east-west confusion's increased
By the Date Line, that fabulous beast.
East Samoa I see
As far west as can be;
West Samoa's in synch with the east.

Dies Irae, the dark Day of Wrath!
You were dumb not to follow the path.
Lacrimosa! You're tearful;
Your last hours, fearful —
They're numbered.  Time's up — do the math.

There's a guy they call Jitterbug Doug
Who is famous for cutting a rug
On the dancefloor. He's king
When the band's playin' swing.
"Aw, 'tain't nuthin'," he says with a shrug.

Cried my dad, "This is torn; it's a crime.
I believe that it came from your rhyme,
And I fear that our pup
Chewed your limerick up.
Please explain the words:
Since
But my lime."

A blockade-runner's got to be swift,
Slipping through every naval wall's rift.
 Their blockade they won't lift
 Since they're miffed at our grift,
So let's shift through the waves. Get my drift?

This verse you are reading is good.
Could it be even better? It could
-n't. (Apart from that there
Enjambed line ending, where
Most would have a full stop, and I should.)

Cuticula dentis, defined
(Don't believe this? It boggles the mind!):
It's the skin of our teeth,
Just a small basal sheath —
Teething tots chew it off (chomp and grind).

To abuccinate, here's what you do:
Assemble an army or two.
First a loud trumpet peal,
Then a shout and a squeal:
It's how dictators make their debut.

Who did something to something just then?
Of those two, was it Bill, was it Ben?
As we all are agreed
That it wasn't the weed,
It was one of those Flower Pot Men.

I'm a techno illiterate, true.
I resist all new gadgets, eschew
Electronic epistles
With digital whistles—
A Day-Timer (datebook) will do.

A person's agraphic if he's
Quite unable to write (a disease).
If its onset is fast,
You won't know when your last
Words are written…

Tony Hancock, asked, "Given before?",
Replied, "Well, I once served in the war."
And, to try to impress,
"Given, no, but spilt, yes!
Should a blood donor give any more?"

Move the loot if you have any sense
To a pawn shop or, better, a fence.
When conditions turn prickly,
A fence will pay quickly.
His cut's just a business expense.

I love to play chess. It's my joy,
But I just like to win. Now, oh boy!
Since the opening I use
Is now certain to lose,
Should I take back my moves, then deploy?

It's rumored that real estate's dying,
So consumers feel poorer, implying
That the holiday sale
Will most probably fail.
That's my theory.  Is anyone buying?

Jock believed Highland Games were a labour
Of love (though his own sport was sabre).
But when running full tilt,
He abandoned his kilt.
People thought he was tossing the caber.

In our bank account (Ray had me trained)
I deposited all that I gained,
But when Ray ran away
With a fey divorcée,
I discovered my cash had been drained.

"Doc, you've tested my testes: no sperm.
Are my gonads too hot—what's that term?"
"No, it's not hyperthermia
That's caused your aspermia—
Your vasectomy's still holding firm."

Here's a word that means "shining" or "bright":
A fulgid thing radiates light.
Though archaic, this word
In zoology's heard,
Meaning "fiery red" — quite a sight.

A bird of Minerva's an owl.
With huge eyes used at night on the prowl
It can swoop on its prey,
And in silence can slay
A large number of rodents and fowl.

The valuer looked at my find:
A Picasso—for so it was signed.
But I came back to earth
When he told me its worth.
'It's quite good, but a fake,' he opined.

My contract, I've learned, is extendable:
I can stay on my job.  That's commendable.
Life will not be destroyed;
I'll sign up and avoid
Joining hordes unemployed and expendable.

Devious, mistrustful, oblique,
Pinter's characters speak, hide, and seek.
With subtextual violence,
Pauses and silence,
Their world is caesural ... Bleak.

On an evening I'll never forget,
I opened my wine cellarette
And found bottles of gin
Where my Riesling had been.
They belong to my husband, I'll bet!

Life's a bitch and a battle for some;
You unendingly slave for a crumb.
Actuality's that
Some stay lean, some get fat.
Keep on truckin' or wind up a bum.

A Peruvian city sits high
In the Andean mountains, where I
Join a climbing team bent
On ascent. Our intent?
Giving Cerro de Pasco a try!

I'm a masochist son of a gun —
Long gauntlets I'm happy to run.
I get maximum kicks
From men lined up with sticks;
So I'll amble instead, just for fun.

Homo sapiens, I watch and despair
While we poison our world without care.
As we plunder and kill
And destroy with a will,
Common sense seems exceedingly rare.

Sequestered for half the semester,
Young Lester met Esther; impressed 'er.
Why'd Lester detest 'er,
Let animus fester?
She pestered him 'cause he obsessed 'er.

Will we like Chaucer's tales? She is doubtous;
Our new prof is uncertain about us.
Though she feels insecure,
Of this fact she is sure:
That her salary'd vanish without us.

You grew up to adulthood and I'm
A proud parent—took part in your climb.
Why d'you now drive me wild,
Sulk and pout like a child?
Please, grow up! It's not nursery time!

The security guard went insane:
"Those needles you cannot retain!
On the airplane, if you
Knit an afghan or two,
They might stand up and hijack the plane!"

"Biretta, beretta, berretta—
Which spelling is best here, or better?
Is it this one or that
We should use for the hat
That a cardinal wears?" asks this fretter.

My grandmas, their mothers and more
Female relatives who went before
Me were ancestresses who
I remember, but too
Often hate, disavow and abhor.

Ace brand bandages, let me explain,
Are a godsend for treating a sprain.
Wrap them 'round and 'round when
Joints are swollen and then
Bayer aspirin will lessen the pain.

When involved in a circular flow
That proceeds to the right, down below,
Then continues above
To the leftward thereof,
Counterclockwise is how you should go.

That "joke" that you told of the stoner
And his climaxing dingus — "deboner" —
Wasn't clever or porny,
Just terribly corny:
A rolling-eyes pun — a real groaner.

The story had such a fine hook
That I got quite caught up in the book—
Didn't notice at all
When the 'quake felled the wall
And the rest of the house shook and shook.

He can't grasp any more; that's a dream:
This is his epistemic extreme.
His cognitive skill
Is now over the hill.
This brute has the brains of a bream.

My mom thought she'd try something quirky:
Not basting our Thanksgiving turkey.
(No sauce brush was used.)
She watched us, bemused,
As we chewed through the bird, dry as jerky.

A perfectionist teacher in school
Had inflexibly cited each rule.
So a student named Chris
WHo wrOte papeRs likE this
Incurred capital punishment. (Fool!)

There's one more on the page, can I duck it?
The last task on my list labeled "bucket".
It's to prove man can fly.
If I fail I will die.
Hey, know what? I'm gonna say fu-geddaboutit.

Amelanchier's a wonderful shrub,
But don't plant one — I'm telling you, bub,
The juneberry's so sweet
To the birds, that they'll eat
Every tender shoot down to a nub.

What's been making the head chef so cross?
His assistant's advanced hearing loss.
He just ruined the veal
Adding Bessemer steel
When it should have been Béchamel sauce.

To sew up, to enclose by a seam,
To include, to contain—that's the theme.
But because I can't sew
(And so much I well know),
Such enseaming will stay but a dream.

Where to go in a nuclear war?
Try a nuclear disco. In store:
As the Earth burned (see Dante),
They'd play Belafonte.
Apocalypso's the name on the door.

In Victorian times, without fail,
Gentlewomen so fragile and pale
Were attended by lasses
From less genteel classes,
Called abigails (never a male).

Though perceived as a great place to play,
Mother Nature builds fences this way.
Holding back the sea's reach
Is a barrier beach,
A thin island twixt ocean and bay.

In the backbending pose called The Wheel,
Put your weight on your hands and each heel.
Then your belly and thighs
Lift and gracefully rise
To an arch with aesthetic appeal.

Muhammad Ali had a move—
Speedy footwork.  This shuffle would prove
Beneficial.  Like running
In place, it was stunning.
He jabbed as he danced in the groove.

My freedom, my essence, he stole.
I'm his puppet, devoid of a soul.
He's a major intrusion,
This "he" of delusion
Who holds all the strings of control.

How can celadon mean such a lot?
It's a color, a glaze, and a pot,
And its yellow-green shade
Is a sage serenade
Of a sunflower covered with snot.

I could see it from right where I stood,
Cute and furry, oft thought of as good.
It's the beaver by name,
Which is often to blame
For a massive collection of wood.

To the left wing he's someone to mock.
To his allies he's more likely Jacques —
They plan to advance
A conservative France
As espoused by her leader, Chirac.

I resigned from that decadent  crowd.
Drugs and drink are no longer allowed.
I've remained clean and sober
Since early October —
An abstainment of which I am proud.

Aeroembolisms hurt you like mad.
Those air bubbles in veins are all bad.
Come up slow when you dive
So the "bends" don't arrive
When you surface. Good luck to you, lad.

The Doge was a leader, elected
Chief Magistrate—seldom rejected
By his subjects in Venice,
Except as a menace,
Of dreadful misconduct suspected.

For reneging on promises made
To The Man, sir, a price must be paid:
To be harassed and hounded,
All assets impounded,
And earmarked for death, I'm afraid.

A bird-watching German named Fritz
Told his frau, "I adore watching tits."
Though a hobby is good,
He was misunderstood.
Now his eyes are reduced to small slits.

Tom's a GOSSIP, but doesn't talk trash
About others. He likes spending cash
On neat gadgets. He works
Day and night, never shirks,
Hoping someday to make a big splash.

I must change the electrical flow
So it goes one direction, and no
Alternation recurs:
My small charger avers
It can commutate cycles just so.

With a talkative fellow, a bore,
I conversed for an hour or more.
So discoursive was he,
When I got up to pee,
That he followed, and talked to the door.

Though this roadhouse, at best, is remote —
Finest steaks? Well, the place gets my vote.
At the crossroads turn right
And then stop for a bite
At "Four Corners", a tavern of note.

If you think the word coupling sounds nice
And your mind links to sex in a trice,
Well, just get back on track:
It's a clackety-clack
Railway wagon's connecting device.

When a skater performs on the ice,
Going airborne adds sparkle and spice.
Double axel's a jump
That gives quite a rump-thump
When you land from those revs not so nice!

Now the Light Brigade's charge seems absurd,
The result of an order misheard.
Russian guns belched their breath
In the Valley of Death:
Dead or injured, two hundred — a third.

"Darling, how may I help you de-stress?
Reduce all that tension?"  "I guess
A massage would be nice."
"There's no need to ask twice —
Just relax while I slip off your dress."

That one night with Lynette?  Boy, it stunk!
Any test for IQ she would flunk.
She had bragged, "I've a great
Double bed!"  Oh, but wait.
Twice the size of a twin?  No, it's bunk.

Hordes of hungry Chinese won't go wrong
At the street food stalls gracing Hong Kong.
Congee, milk tea, and noodle
Or other cheap food'll
Taste great at a nice dai pai dong.

This bug's life cycle truly amazes:
Two full years, over five or six phases.
The tall conifer's view
Is not hard to construe:
Darned adelgids can all go to blazes.

"This all came to be," said the Greek,
"When a force formed the world—a unique,
Cosmoplastic first cause
Born of natural laws—
And not God." (The creationists freak.)

Aida, as Verdi composed,
Was abducted to Egypt, deposed.
She became a mere slave,
But died noble and brave—
She and Radames, in a tomb closed.

When assigning the note of a debtor
One should ask what is legally better:
For assignors to sign, or
Employ an assigner?
It's not merely the change of a letter.

I just can't seem to part from Miss Mazie.
I'm smitten; her eyes drive me crazy,
And she's smart as a whip.
Dang, I'm losing my grip.
She's the whole enchilada: a daisy!

We should smash every shield that's pro-white,
And pro-black, for that's also not right.
So let's crack our warm jokes
About any darn folks
Because humour's a source of delight.

It's the largest of citrus, and can
Have a twelve-inch diameter span.
This pamplemousse, too,
Gives us ample juice; you
Need a sweet Bali lemon, young man!

With continuants, here is the thing:
There's no end to the sound that they bring
To a word till you say,
"Well, let's call it a day."
An example of this would be zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzing!

Giving clues at pronouncing is nice,
And they needn't be super-precise.
Even "AYN-shent ee-JIP-shehn",
In our broad transcription,
You'd speak without further advice.

Eurasia's divided in two
By the wide Dardanelles, which cuts through
Where the Brits battled Turks,
And attacked Turkish works,
But the Brits, in defeat, all withdrew.

Says Pharaoh, as tears start to splatter,
"Don't cry, o Sphinx—what is the matter?"
"My head's from a ram!
As a sphinx, I'm a sham.
They can smile, while I bleat and I batter."

Ever smooth, but a few termed uncouth,
Are the paintings of Mr. Demuth.
His gold figure of five
Is a still life — alive,
Celebrating that number, forsooth.

The anti-Darwinian crowd
In the pulpits refuse to be cowed.
"Evolution," they scream,
"Is the atheist's scheme
To deny we're divinely endowed."

Yes, I'm Biden. My time is near done.
Could I win? Should I sit? Should I run.
Can a regular Joe
Ever make it past Go?
Looks like Hillary's not having fun.

Those who make western prairies their home
Will proclaim that the buffalo roam.
It's no use to ask why, son—
The right word is bison,
And that is the point of this poem.

Then there's choanoid: shaped like a funnel—
Wide then small, like a very short tunnel.
Would a knife clinch your view
That this meaning is true?
You think not? Well then, maybe this gun'll.

For this difficult task I prepare.
The expression, or game face, I wear
Shows the focus I need,
With resolve, to succeed.
The sad truth is I don't stand a prayer.

Adjusting antenna direction
For satellite station selection
Is truly a snap:
I've a dish-pointer app—
Directivity gives me detection.

How I wish that a photon eject me
From my valence abode, and deflect me
Not too far from the ground;
I remain Coulomb bound
To a hole. Now just try and detect me!

If two persons receive equal share
So, in consequence, nothing's left spare,
Use this phrase: it's quite nifty,
And means fifty-fifty.
Even stevens means all's fair and square.

'Tis the season to gather and glean.
The harvest is ripe. Let's convene:
As we enter these lands,
Your acquiring hands
Are for pillaging. Wipe the place clean.

E: a vitamin great for the skin.
Ea: a stream where great rivers begin.
Ear: an organ to hear.
Earl: a name for a peer.
Early: time before others get in.

If smoothies get boring, for sure,
Amazonian fruit is the cure!
Mango's so yesterday;
Pomegranate? Passé.
The açaí's the fad juice du jour.

It's alphamegamia we've got.
Today we'll be tying the knot.
Friends and family disparage
Our dating and marriage.
I'm 20.  She's 80 and hot.

If our words are too modern for you,
Or you hunger to see us renew
Some outdated sets
Of language, then let's
Have archaic and eateth it too.

16 Tauri (Celaeno) shows lustre
Though fifth magnitude's all she can muster.
The wife of Poseidon,
She's always found hidin'
'Midst sisters, the Pleiades cluster.

If you're kicked in the ankle, then you
May observe that it turns black-and-blue,
But this bruise or contusion
Should breed no confusion.
The blood pigment causes the hue.

My old missus I tried to embalm,
But she wiggled! I jumped in alarm.
Then ballistic she went,
Her last breath not yet spent.
It took ages to get her to calm.

If you count 1, 2, 3 (yes, it's dull),
For forever, with never a lull,
Then the value will wend
(Even though there's no end)
To our transfinite friend, aleph-null.

Take the flanged pipe (the one with the rim)
And the plain pipe (the one smooth and slim).
In the flanged one, that's fatter,
Slide the thin one. (The latter
Is flangeless.) Too long? Simply trim.

If more people arrive than you wish—
And you're wanting roast beef or some fish—
Try aforcing your meal.
Grain or dairy's ideal
To bolster the bulk of your dish.

Every book in our school, every text,
Is degenderized; kids are perplexed.
When a sex text surrenders,
And stops naming genders,
We shrug and we wonder—what's next?

The chinchilla rat wears French cologne
And it worships Sylvester Stallone.
I'm making up stuff
For the data is rough;
Very little about it is known.

Said Darwin, whenever a critter
Succeeds in its niche, being fitter,
Its survivorship means
That it passes its genes
To its next-generational litter.

The troopers were turned out of bed,
And commanded to climb Beachy Head.
They accomplished that end,
And were told to descend:
Thus a regiment's ducally led.

I roared, "Go for broke, Blanche!  You are
At this banquet the ultimate star.
Yours carte blanche—any dish,
Any drink that you wish!"
(Then I had to cart Blanche to the car.)

They asked Gandhi (when hubris was king)
What he thought about (praises he'd sing?)
Western civilization.
With scant hesitation
He said, "It would be a good thing."

All hospitals keep it in stock—
Anesthesia that acts as a block,
Interrupting the train
Of the pain to your brain
And explaining your love for the doc.

I'll rub and I'll scrub till I'm sore,
Till I'm looking bright red and quite raw.
I'll exfoliate well;
I'll remove each dead cell
From my skin and unclog every pore.

With a chainsaw she cut through  my door,
And, waving it, charged with a roar.
"I'm unstable, you say?"
She screamed, "I'll fillet!!!!"
That's one nun I won't date any more.

A baleen is a type of a whale,
Which sharp sailors' harpoons would impale.
Their baleen strains the krill,
Of which whales eat their fill,
But as whalebone formed corsets for sale.

Accostable? That's my friend Jack,
He'll chat and then welcome you back.
For some help or a natter,
Especially the latter,
Choose him, as he does have the knack.

My location right then? In hot water—
A lamb to be led to the slaughter.
I had caught it, it's true,
In the neck, but who knew
That this chick was some senator's daughter?

At a recent audition in Stowe,
A castable starlet said, "No!"
Then she fell off the couch
And arose and said, "Ouch!"
Doctors found her leg castable though.

Once a barfly from Barstow, Bernard,
(Barred from bars—he was drinking too hard)
Did, in pain and disgrace,
Try to burn down one place.
Behind bars, he's a barber and bard.

The indefinite article's done
When it says, "Here's my noun, gotta run!"
But if sounded as AY
And then stressed, that's the way
That an a gets to say, "Only one."

Here's a line from you men that has tensed me
And every so often incensed me:
"If I told you you're hot
And that body you've got
Is divine, would you hold it against me?"

These builders are cheap, but by rights,
Being thrifty should not mean such slights.
Though we all make mistakes,
No foundations?! That takes
Cutting corners to dizzy new heights!

When a church or a courthouse grows high,
Let a piece of it reach for the sky.
To summon or warn
(As well as adorn),
A bell tower catches your eye.

The Baron did not care to share
A small cell with those already there.
So he paid them all chummage
Then told them to rummage
And find somewhere else to repair.

When your mind's on that old beaten track
And you just can't face hitting the sack;
When you've had too much booze
And you're full of the blues,
Then it's time for the old Man in Black.

Those beatings and shootings?  Unjust!
I condemn them as anyone must.
But I'll make myself clear
That I won't interfere.
Take a stand?  Yes, by showing disgust.

An atrophic appendage is shrunk.
When it's lifted, it falls with a klunk.
Its muscles, lambasted,
Are scrawny and wasted—
I mean they are stunted, not drunk.

What's that word for the first part of night?
Is it sunset, or dusk, even twilight?
When the sun's dipped below
The horizon, you know?
Of course! It's crepuscule, that's right.

If there's arsenite found in your well,
You should drink Perrier for a spell.
If it's found in your food,
Then you have to conclude
You've been poisoned.  You'd best say "farewell."

Down the straight, this Black Caviar's hot!
She strides to the front, round the lot.
Raise a toast: they're all toast
As she coasts past the post
At a trot, twenty-five on the trot!

All internal reports at Ink Inc.
Say the firm is robust, in the pink.
Is this true? I'm not clear,
Since there's one thing I fear:
All external reports say we stink.

Thongs were flip-flops to wear on your feet;
Now they're undies for framing your seat.
This absurd little string
Doesn't cover a thing.
Displayed buttfloss is most indiscreet!

The Manchester Guardian became
The Guardian, whose comical name
Is The Grauniad. Why?
'Cause the mag' Private Eye
Named its typos its main claim to fame.

In the period pre-World War Two,
The style blackface, it's sad but it's true,
Featured jokes at their basest,
Incredibly racist,
To please folks of modest IQ.

Pulmonologists use—with compunctions—
Caffeine citrate; although this drug functions
As a cardio- (heart)
-acceleratory (quick start),
It prompts breathing and calms bronchial junctions.

Peach takes stock as gangs fight, her eyes gazing
First left and then right.  Both guns blazing,
She cuts down three of each.
I have heard this gal preach
Evenhandedness. Peach is amazing!

Caponata, Sicilian dish,
Sweet-and-sour eggplant salad — delish.
Vegans, don't be alarmed,
As no capons get harmed
(Though it's relished by locals with fish).

Your bed was uncomfortable, true?
And you noticed the crack in the loo?
This hotel is a hole
Since we feel it's our goal
To discommodate people like you.

Archaeopteryx lies there inert,
A fossil that's buried in dirt.
Looking closer you'll see
In amongst the debris
That his end came while eating dessert.

If she wants her skirt fuller, she gets
Her tailor to make some godets.
(In a French-sounding way,
You can say it "goh-DAY".)
Strips of cloth in the pleats he insets.

Sandy clay that's commixed in bank gravel
Makes it gravel that's rough to unravel.
After sieving and spreading,
It's rural road bedding:
A deposit to bank on for travel.

An anthropomorphist is one
Who attributes to things like the sun
Personifications
Of human sensations
(Example: "Sun Rising", by Donne).

There's Thaddea, dear Vesper's mom,
At a Paris café, très bon,
When soup took a spill
Down her dress (what a thrill!)
And her elegant meal went quite wrong!

Desecration's a sin that's extreme
That provokes true believers to scream,
As they're straining to handle
The pain when a vandal
Profanes what they hold in esteem.

In some restaurants, charges are added.
I hate it if checks have been padded.
When charged in some venues
For use of the menus,
Reacting, I've often "Egad!"-ed.

Certain goods you might offer for sale
Will have trimmings, or scraps. The defrayal
Of this loss will be met
By two pounds that you get
Per three hundred, the cloff, on your scale.

My bright eyes look up at you pertly.
My attention is on you, alertly.
I just want to play
And eat food every day.
If not, I will lie here inertly.

My new history book takes a fix on
Politicians who've played dirty tricks on
An opponent or rival
To deny him survival.
I focus on Richard M. Nixon.

For acceptance he hoped on inspection.
The sampling, though, led to rejection.
The guy had to scratch
The whole merchandise batch,
For defectiveness prompts a defection.

Slow food, gigot, is one leg of meat.
For example, the lamb cut's a treat
That is often revered
'Cause it's patiently seared
And a heavenly portion to eat.

The dumbstruck young man was un-grounded,
Bewildered, confused, and confounded,
Astonished, amazed,
Flabbergasted, and dazed—
Stunned speechless, appalled, and astounded.

When one desinence comes with a bang
But each subsequent ending goes clank,
You've got dissonance — lack
Of sweet harmony. Hark
At the discord, the desinent clunk.

An  avatar:  god's  incarnation,
Lord Vishnu's personification.
To follow the dharma
Will bring you good  karma—
Your duty includes adoration.

On safari, e.g. in the Congo,
One may often encounter a bongo,
And although there are some
Who suppose it's a drum,
It's an antelope (striped), so they're wrongo.

This delusion I have of negation
Is a matter of utmost frustration
To those who agree
That there is a world. Me?
I just know it's a long-dead location.

He's got perfect duende, I say,
And he charms at Jose's Cabaret.
His flamenco's enchanting:
Señoritas—they're panting.
They follow him home every day.

Our exiguous share of the crop
Didn't bring very much at the shop:
A rough tick for our bed,
Needed dry goods and thread,
And for Timmy, a store-bought'n top.

In our country, when push comes to shove,
We have rules that no person's above.
Despite all our flaws,
We're a nation of laws—
Our morass and solution thereof.

An abecedarian knows
Just where all of the alphabet goes.
But I'm needing to find
A numerical mind
Who will teach me the 1-2-3-0's.

Will our nation be damning its fate
When McCain and Obama debate,
And we choose 'tween a fib
From a lib who is glib
And a lie by a guy who talks straight?

Do you both need to talk through one wire?
Is your need to print two-sided dire?
Two devices, one name—
They're not one and the same,
But a duplexer's what you require.

In letters adjacent, I find
Too few words.  Now I'm so far behind,
It brings utter surprise;
After two dozen tries,
I'm still winless — it boggles the mind.

God, it's muggy! There's damp in the air.
I can tell by the state of my hair.
Super-curly, no doubt
Twenty inches straight out—
Even blind people can't help but stare.

If the Church or the Vatican dares
To meddle with Government's cares,
Conclude a concordat
For keeping the Lord at
A distance from Caesar's affairs.

Piccard, he's the guy who created
A sphere to keep pressure abated.
In a bathyscaphe, laugh
With the rest of the staff
While your team gets those sea maps updated!

On a flight from Brazil to Peru,
No landing strip came into view.
My Cessna was sputtering.
Oaths I was uttering.
Thank God! There's an airfield! Whew!

Your values are sharply defined,
Absolute; you're so rigid of mind.
The prism you use
Just refracts in two hues:
Black and white.  Shades of gray aren't assigned.

An exuberant fellow named Mears
Whooped, "Life's great! I'm so happy! No fears!
I'm reborn (thank you, Jesus!)
And richer than Croesus.
My friends — to the world — I say cheers!"

Are ya bloated, ya feel like you're double?
You're edematous, pal — you're in trouble.
The fluids that fill you
Might possibly kill you.
Let's drain out your billowing bubble.

Baseball manager Joe's in a bind
He's in trouble, opponents don't mind.
Although A-Rod and staff
Are no comfort, don't laugh,
As a penance no pennants he'll find.

Carbonic's a word that applies
To a compound that partly relies
On the element C—
Like H2CO3.
That's an acid with carbonate ties.

Cried the doomsayer, brimming with mirth,
"Watch the Judgment of everyone's worth!
Buy your tickets real soon—
Doomsday's coming at noon!
Get good seats for the end of the Earth!"

A collision I'd hoped to avoid,
But my wife, that damn airbag, annoyed
With her chatter nonstop.
With a vein 'bout to pop,
I then crashed, and the airbags deployed.

My wife said, "I must be emphatic,
Bold and concise."  So dramatic!
"What is it my dear?"
She said, "Let me be clear:
Your girlfriend can't live in the attic!"

Sir, he came for me, eyes fixed and glazed,
So I knocked him galley-west. He fell, dazed.
Before long he came back
For a second attack.
Sir, I clocked him again: he looked crazed.

What woke up Zypher's brother?
